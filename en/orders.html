  <h1>Orders</h1>

  <p>This chapter explains all the possible orders that you can give to your
  units. We'll start by explaining the notation we have used throughout. As
  an example, let's take <tt>HELP faction-id COMBAT [ NOT ]</tt>, an order to
  specify whether or not you do or don't help another faction when it is
  attacked.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Keywords, in this case <tt>HELP</tt>, <tt>COMBAT</tt>, and
    <tt>NOT</tt>, are written in capital letters. You don't have to write
    them in capital letters yourself, though most people do.</li>

    <li>Place holders are written as in small letters. You're not supposed to
    copy them, but instead to fill them in with your own. In this case,
    instead of faction-id, write the id of the faction that you want to apply
    the order to.<br />
    Occasionally, you see this written as &lt;faction-id&gt;. It means the
    same thing, and the &lt; and &gt; symbols must not appear in your
    orders.</li>

    <li>Words in [] brackets are optional so they may or may not be part of
    the order. In this case, <tt>NOT</tt> does not have to be included - but
    the order has different meanings depending on whether or not you include
    it.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Long orders are marked with an &lt;L&gt;.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a name="ATTACK" id="ATTACK">ATTACK</a> unit-id &lt;L*&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      This will cause the unit to attack the specified other unit. You must
      specify a separate <tt>ATTACK</tt> order for every unit you want to
      attack. A unit that has set its <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">combat behaviour</a>
      to <tt>FLEE</tt> or <tt>NOT</tt> cannot attack.

      <p>This order is only considered long if the battle takes more than one
      round. Otherwise, an additional long order can be executed.</p>

      <p>The ATTACK order is a pseudo-long order. You can issue more than one
      ATTACK order, but an ATTACK order prevents the execution of other long
      orders if a battle actually takes place. Note, that for this purpose a
      unit is only participating in battle if on the average all persons of
      this unit have attacked or defended at least once during the battle.
      Thus, if one side defeats the other and not all persons of a unit
      attacked an enemy or defended against an enemy attack, the unit can
      execute another long order. This evaluation is done unit by unit. It is
      recommended to add another long order to be executed after very short
      battles. Do not count on its execution and do not include any results
      of these orders (silver, products, etc.) into your plans.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="BANNER" id="BANNER">BANNER</a> "text"</dt>

    <dd>
      Use this order to change the description of your faction. It will be
      shown to all players that see at least one of your units in their
      report, and you should use it to give your real name, alternate email
      Addresses or information about holiday leave.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    BANNER "On vacation. My backup until June 7th, 2001 is Henning, faroul@gmx.de"
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="BUY" id="BUY">BUY</a> amount
    luxury-item&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L*&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Given this order a unit tries to buy the specified amount of the
      specified luxury item. The unit needs to be skilled in trading, the
      luxury item needs to be for sale and there has to be a trading post or
      larger castle in the region. The unit can acquire 10 luxury items per
      person and trading skill level. For more information see the chapter on
      <a href="income.html#trade">trade</a>.

      <p><tt>BUY</tt> and <a href="orders.html#SELL"><tt>SELL</tt></a> are pseudo-long
      orders, i.e. a unit can carry out any number of <tt>BUY</tt> and
      <tt>SELL</tt> orders in the same turn but no other long order. Note
      that the limitation of 10 luxury items per person and trading skill
      level applies to all <tt>BUY</tt> and <tt>SELL</tt> orders of a unit in
      total.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="CARRY" id="CARRY">CARRY</a> unit-id</dt>

    <dd>
      With this order you can give other units a ride. The carried units have
      to issue the <a href="orders.html#RIDE"><tt>RIDE</tt></a> order for the carrier.
      One <tt>CARRY</tt> order is required for each unit to be transported.
      <pre>
    ERESSEA 125 "FooBar"
        UNIT 311
            RIDE 456 ; I need a ride
            [...]

    ERESSEA 300 "BarFoo"
        UNIT 456
            CARRY 311 ; transport unit 311
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="CLAIM" id="CLAIM">CLAIM</a> [amount] item</dt>

    <dd>
      Claims items from the faction pool.

      <p>Every unit in your faction can claim items from the faction pool,
      but it is not possible to put items into the faction pool. The unit
      who gives the CLAIM order gets the item and can use it in the same
      week or give it away.</p>

      <p>The faction pool is only used by the game master to give special
      items to players without giving them to a specific unit. You will not
      have to worry about it (or the CLAIM order) much.</p>

      <p>NB: Do not mistake the faction pool for the item pool!</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="CAST" id="CAST">CAST</a> [parameter] "spell"
    [parameter]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L*&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      This will make the unit cast a spell. The exact syntax of each spell
      can be found in the spell description and in the <a href=
      "magic.html">chapter on magic</a>. To get the description of a spell
      use the <a href="orders.html#SHOW"><tt>SHOW</tt></a> order and it will appear
      again in your report.

      <p>This order cannot be used to cast combat spells. See the <a href=
      "orders.html#COMBATSPELL">COMBATSPELL</a> order in this chapter for more details
      on how to use magic in battles.</p>

      <p>While <tt>CAST</tt> is technically a long order, you may issue
      multiple <tt>CAST</tt> orders in one week.</p>

      <p>Usually, new spells are obtained by reaching a new skill level in
      magic.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="COMBAT" id="COMBAT">COMBAT</a><br />
    COMBAT AGGRESSIVE<br />
    COMBAT NOT<br />
    COMBAT REAR<br />
    COMBAT DEFENSIVE<br />
    COMBAT FLEE<br />
    COMBAT HELP [NOT]</dt>

    <dd>
      This order determines a unit's behaviour in <a href=
      "combat.html">combat</a>.

      <p><tt>COMBAT AGGRESSIVE</tt>: In combat, the unit will take the front
      and it will fight to the death. This is a reasonable setting for cannon
      fodder.</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT</tt>: In combat, the unit will take the front row.
      It will try to flee from the battle field when it is severely wounded
      (less than 20% of its hit points left). It's a good idea to set this
      for 'valuable' front row fighters like well-trained swordsmen.</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT REAR</tt>: The unit will take a second row position
      in combat. It will try to flee from the battle
      field when it is severely wounded (less than 20% of its hit points
      left). After the front row is shattered, the units of the second row
      engage in close combat. You might want to give this order to your
      bowmen.</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT DEFENSIVE</tt>: This status is identical to <tt>COMBAT
      REAR</tt> except the unit tries to flee after it is slightly wounded
      (less than 90% of its hit points left). A sensible order for
      magicians.</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT NOT</tt>: The unit takes part in combat only if it is
      directly attacked by an enemy unit. The unit tries to flee from the
      battle field as soon as it gets slightly wounded (less than 90% of
      its hit points left). This would be a reasonable status for craftsmen
      and units with advanced stealth skills.</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT FLEE</tt>: Units given this order try to escape from
      battle field when they would be drawn into combat. For every
      unit the basic chance of a successful flight is 25% (Halflings: 50%).
      Another 10% are added for a horse and 5% for each level of the unit's
      stealth skill. Yet, the best possible chance of escape is 75%
      (Halflings: 90%).</p>

      <p><tt>COMBAT HELP</tt>: The <tt>COMBAT HELP NOT</tt> order prevents a
      fighting unit from involving other units (of your own or allied
      factions) in the combat. If a unit with this combat status is attacked,
      no other allied unit participates in the combat - as long as no other
      unit without this combat status gets attacked. Also see the <a href=
      "HELP"><tt>HELP</tt></a> order.</p>

      <p>Note that you can set only one of the <tt>COMBAT</tt>, <tt>COMBAT
      AGGRESSIVE</tt>, <tt>REAR</tt>, <tt>DEFENSIVE</tt>, <tt>NOT</tt>, or
      <tt>FLEE</tt> status but at the same time set <tt>COMBAT HELP</tt> or
      <tt>COMBAT HELP NOT</tt> for a unit.</p>

      <p>For more details, also see the chapters on <a href=
      "combat.html">combat</a> and <a href=
      "alliances.html">alliances</a>.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="COMBATSPELL" id="COMBATSPELL">COMBATSPELL</a> [LEVEL n]
    "spell" [NOT]</dt>

    <dd>
      The specified spell is - depending on the spell type - set as normal,
      pre- or post-combat spell. Optionally, a casting level can be set, e.g.
      to keep some aura for a post-combat spell. When magicians get involved
      in a battle they cast their combat spells automatically.

      <p>Note that not all spells can be used as combat spells. The spell
      description tells you the nature of a spell. To retrieve the spell
      description, use the <a href="SHOW"><tt>SHOW</tt></a> order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="CONTACT" id="CONTACT">CONTACT</a> unit-id</dt>

    <dd>
      To give items to another unit, the recipient unit needs to be allied to
      you (see <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP GIVE</tt></a>), unless it
      explicitly grants your unit the right to give it something using the
      <tt>CONTACT</tt> order.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    ERESSEA 125 "FooBar"
        UNIT 311
        GIVE 456 1000 Silver ; Pay Tribute!
        [...]

    ERESSEA 300 "BarFoo"
        UNIT 456
        CONTACT 311 ; payment is allowed.
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="DEFAULT" id="DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> "order"</dt>

    <dd>
      This order allows you to specify an order for the following turn(s). It
      is displayed in your next orders template as the default order.

      <p>Caution! The standard default order will be overwritten by that!
      Thus, you can even assign <a href="orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a> as a
      default order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="DESCRIBE" id="DESCRIBE">DESCRIBE</a> UNIT "text"<br />
    DESCRIBE BUILDING "text"<br />
    DESCRIBE SHIP "text"<br />
    DESCRIBE REGION "text"<br />
    DESCRIBE PRIVATE "text"</dt>

    <dd>
      Changes the description of the specified object. A description is
      displayed behind the object and can contain up to 400 characters.
      Objects do not receive a description automatically.

      <p>For ships, buildings and regions there are the same rules as for
      <a href="orders.html#NAME"><tt>NAME</tt></a>: Buildings and ships can only be
      described by the unit owning them (the first unit under the object in
      your report). A region can only be described by the lord of the biggest
      castle in that region.</p>

      <p><tt>DESCRIBE PRIVATE</tt> allows you give a unit a "private"
      description that is visible to the unit's owner only.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="DESTROY" id="DESTROY">DESTROY</a> [size]<br />
    DESTROY [size] ROAD direction</dt>

    <dd>
      A unit owning a ship or building can reduce its size or destroy it
      completely anytime. There ist no skill needed for doing so. The size
      parameter determines the amount by which a building is torn down or the
      percentage by which a ship is damaged. Note that ships can only be
      disassembled or sunk in a region next to an ocean; a crew would never
      sink their own ship out on the ocean.

      <p>Streets can be demolished via <tt>DESTROY [size] ROAD
      direction</tt>. When other factions <a href="orders.html#GUARD">guard</a> the
      region, their <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP GUARD</tt></a> status has to be
      set for your faction. Furhtermore, the unit executing the
      <tt>DESTROY</tt> order has to be skilled in roadwork. You may decrease
      the street's size by one per Skill point.</p>

      <p>A unit may destroy only one structure (building, street or ship)
      per week.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="EMAIL" id="EMAIL">EMAIL</a> e-mail-adress</dt>

    <dd>
      Sets the e-mail address your report will be sent to. Your e-mail
      address has to be specified 'as is'.

      <p>Correct: EMAIL eressea@beyond.kn-bremen.de<br />
      Wrong: EMAIL "email: eressea@beyond.kn-bremen.de"<br />
      Wrong: EMAIL "Henning Peters &lt;eressea@beyond.kn-bremen.de&gt; "</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="END" id="END">END</a></dt>

    <dd>
      This terminates the order-block of a temporary unit created by <a href=
      "orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE TEMP</tt></a>.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    MAKE TEMP 1
        NAME UNIT "Joggonarag Thorggh"
        RECRUIT 1
        LEARN magic
    END
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="ENTER" id="ENTER">ENTER</a> CASTLE building-id<br />
    ENTER SHIP ship-id</dt>

    <dd>
      Enter the given building or ship (you have to use <tt>ENTER CASTLE</tt>
      for all buildings even if you want to enter a port for example). If the
      owner of the building or ship does not belong to your own or an allied
      faction, it has to issue the <a href="orders.html#CONTACT"><tt>CONTACT</tt></a>
      order in the same turn.

      <p>A unit on a ship or in a building <a href="orders.html#LEAVE">leaves</a> it
      automatically when ordered to <tt>ENTER</tt> another one.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="ENTERTAIN" id="ENTERTAIN">ENTERTAIN</a>
    [amount]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      A unit with this order spends a turn entertaining the peasants. It can
      earn up to 20 pieces of silver per person and skill level in
      entertainment. The peasants spend five percent of their silver on
      entertainment. If there are more entertainers in the region than the
      peasants would pay, the silver is divided up among the entertaining
      units. You can specify a maximum amount of silver to be earned through
      entertainment.

      <p>Example: The peasants of a region own 1200 pieces of silver. Thus,
      the maximum amount of silver to be earned in this region is 1200 × 5% =
      60.<br />
      Take two units: A with one person and an entertainment skill level of
      one, B with two persons and an entertainment skill level of two. A
      could earn 1 × 1 × 20 = 20 pieces of silver, B 2 × 2 × 20 = 80 pieces,
      i.e. a total of 100 pieces of silver.<br />
      Since the region will only yield 60 pieces of silver, they are split up
      at a ratio of about 20:80. Thus, A earns about 12 and B about 48 pieces
      of silver.</p>

      <p>Units on board a ship in a <a href="orders.html#GUARD">guarded region</a> can
      neither <a href="orders.html#WORK">work</a> nor entertain.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="ERESSEA" id="ERESSEA">ERESSEA</a> faction-id "password"</dt>

    <dd>This order marks the beginning or your faction's orders in an order
    file. It is an absolute requirement to use this order.</dd>

    <dt><a name="FOLLOW" id="FOLLOW"></a> FOLLOW UNIT
    unit-id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;(L)&gt;<br />
    FOLLOW SHIP ship-id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Makes your unit follow another unit or a ship.

      <p>Being assigned <tt>FOLLOW UNIT</tt> makes your unit watch and follow
      the given unit when it moves. If the other unit can move faster than
      your unit, your unit will loose its track and the other unit will get
      away. The pursuers will follow as far as they can. If the pursued unit
      does not move, your own unit can execute another long order.</p>

      <p><tt>FOLLOW SHIP</tt> allows you to follow ships having trespassed
      the region in same or the previous turn. A captain being told to
      <tt>FOLLOW SHIP</tt> pursues the ship until his ship has caught up with
      it (if his own ship is fast enough). <tt>FOLLOW SHIP</tt> is always a
      long order.</p>

      <p>FOLLOW just works for the turn the order is issued. If the command
      should be repeated (until revoked by removing it) put a @ in front of
      it.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 87b6
        FOLLOW UNIT hz7
        ENTERTAIN
</pre>

      <p>Unit 87b6 will watch unit hz7 and follow it if it moves. If it
      doesn't, 87b6 will try to earn money by entertaining the peasants.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="FORGET" id="FORGET">FORGET</a> skill</dt>

    <dd>This will order a unit to completely forget a skill; all knowledge of
    the skill is lost to the unit - including knowledge given by birth with
    some races. This can be useful in situations where a unit knows a
    quota-limited skill like magic and you want to train another unit in the
    skill instead.</dd>

    <dt><a name="GIVE" id="GIVE">GIVE</a> unit-id HERBS<br />
    GIVE unit-id CONTROL<br />
    GIVE unit-id UNIT<br />
    GIVE unit-id amount MEN<br />
    GIVE unit-id amount item<br />
    GIVE unit-id ALL MEN<br />
    GIVE unit-id ALL [item]<br />
    GIVE 0 amount MEN<br />
    GIVE 0 amount item</dt>

    <dd>
      Your unit can hand over any item it possesses to another unit, but only
      if this unit accepts the given object. The other unit will do this only
      if it belongs to the same or an <a href="orders.html#HELP">allied</a> faction or
      if it has been ordered to <a href="orders.html#CONTACT">contact</a> the giving
      unit in the same turn. Most items can also be thrown away (<tt>GIVE 0
      ...</tt>).

      <p>Of course, the giving and the receiving unit have to be in the same
      region. <tt>GIVE</tt> does also work on the high seas between two ships
      as well as from a ship to the shore or the other way around.</p>

      <p>Items and silver handed over by <tt>GIVE</tt> are automatically
      <a href="orders.html#RESERVE">reserved</a> and do neither account for the <a href=
      "income.html#pools">item pool</a> nor can they be reserved by another
      unit.</p>

      <p>Instead of a certain number of items you can also use <tt>ALL</tt>.
      E.g. <tt>GIVE unit-id ALL silver</tt> makes your unit give away any
      silver it owns. <tt>GIVE unit-id ALL</tt> hands over all items, herbs,
      potions and silver, but not the men of a unit. Using <tt>GIVE unit-id
      ALL MEN</tt> explicitly makes your unit give all its men to the
      receiver and your unit is afterwards.</p>

      <p>If you want to give men from one unit to another, you can use
      <tt>GIVE unit-id amount MEN</tt> order. This mixes the skills of the
      two units. If you give all men of a unit to another one, do not forget
      to hand over all items as well. Otherwise they are lost to the
      peasants.</p>

      <p>Using <tt>GIVE unit-id UNIT</tt> you can give a complete unit to
      another faction including all items the unit owns. Your unit is not
      'added' to the foreign unit as usual; instead it joins the other
      faction. Thus, each faction can gain up to 5 men per turn.</p>

      <p>A unit owning a ship or building can pass the ownership to another
      unit via the <tt>GIVE unit-id CONTROL</tt>order. The owner of a
      building or a ship can decide who is allowed to enter it. <tt>GIVE
      unit-id CONTROL</tt> should be also used if the owner is going to leave
      the ship or building and a specific should be the new owner. Otherwise
      another unit could gain the ownership although it is not the second
      unit in the building or on the ship respectively. New owners of a building
      get not until the next turn the bonus (e.g. the mining bonus) because they
      are only placed at the first position in the building at the end of the
      turn.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    GIVE k3f 300 silver  ; give 300 silver to k3f .
    GIVE 0 5 stones  ; throw away 5 stones.
    GIVE TEMP 3 7 MEN  ; give 7 men to the new unit temp 3.
</pre>

      <p>Caution! The orders between <a href="orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE TEMP</tt></a>
      and <a href="orders.html#END"><tt>END</tt></a> are orders for the new unit. The
      new unit does not have money, so the following orders will not
      work:</p>
      <pre>
    MAKE TEMP 1
        GIVE TEMP 1 200 silver  ;  error!
        RECRUIT 2
        MOVE West
    END
</pre>Better put it this way:
      <pre>
    GIVE TEMP 1 200 Silber
      MAKE TEMP 1
          RECRUIT 2
          MOVE West
      END
      ; GIVE TEMP 1 200 Silber  ;  or even here!
</pre>

    <dd>
      GROUP allows you to divide your faction into smaller groups being able
      to have a different <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP</tt></a> status than the
      rest of your faction. E.g. you could form a group of mercenaries
      helping your client on his island while the rest of your faction does
      not.

      <p>You could also delete every <tt>HELP COMBAT</tt> status for a
      participant of a tournament preventing him from disturbing a single
      combat. It is also possible to attack an ally with a bunch of disguised
      warriors without betraying yourself by giving up <tt>HELP COMBAT</tt>
      for your whole faction. And someone who wants to protect his woods from
      his allies, too, can form a group of gamekeepers granting <tt>HELP
      GUARD</tt> to nobody.</p>

      <p>E.g. a unit is ordered to join the group "Pirates of the Seas" via
      <tt>GROUP "Pirates of the Seas"</tt>. If this group does not yet exist,
      it is created and initially has the same <tt>HELP</tt> status as the
      rest of the faction. <tt>GROUP</tt> without a name can be used to leave
      a group. Each unit can belong to one group only. A unit issuing the
      <tt>HELP</tt> order changes the <tt>HELP</tt> status of its group if it
      belongs to one or the status of the whole faction if it does not belong
      to a group.</p>

      <p>During a battle, each group forms a separate army, just like it
      happens if units are <a href="orders.html#HIDE">disguised</a>.</p>

    <dd>
      Given this order a unit can try to grow horses in a <a href=
      "buildings.html#stable">stable</a> or to grow herbs in a region.

      <p>With the <tt>GROW HORSES</tt> order, a unit has one try per person,
      taming skill level and turn to grow a horse. The chance of success for
      each try is <dfn>skill-level(taming)</dfn> percent.</p>

      <p>Example: 3 persons with a taming skill at level 5 get 3 × 5 = 15
      tries each with a 5% success rate to grow a horse.</p>

      <p>Growing horses requires a stable with at least two horses and at
      least one horse per breeding try (i.e. 15 horses in the above
      example).</p>

      <p>The <tt>GROW HERBS</tt> order demands a minimum skill level of six
      in herbalism. The unit tries to grow one herb per skill level; it needs
      a corresponding amount of the appropriate type of herb as well as a
      vial of the water of life. You cannot grow a different kind of herb than the
      one originally found in the region.</p>

    <dt><a name="GUARD" id="GUARD">GUARD</a> [NOT]</dt>

    <dd>
      Units can guard regions if they are armed and have the appropriate
      weapon skill. To guard a region prevents non-allied units from
      collecting taxes, gathering resources and recruiting peasants in that
      region (from the following turn on) and non-allied units trying to
      travel through the region will be stopped with a certain probability.
      There is one exception to this: if your STEALTH exceeds the PERCEPTION
      of the guarding faction you can collect taxes, recruit new peasants or
      produce raw materials.

      <p>Your units on ships cannot <a href="orders.html#WORK"><tt>WORK</tt></a> or
      <a href="orders.html#ENTERTAIN"><tt>ENTERTAIN</tt></a> in a guarded region (except
      the guarding faction has set <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP GUARD</tt></a>
      status for your faction).</p>

      <p>The <tt>GUARD</tt> order becomes effective only one turn after
      being issued because the guards have to find out where non-allied units
      earn money before they can prevent them from doing so. If a guard moves
      to another region, or is given the order GUARD NOT, it quits its guarding duties.</p>

      <p>A guarding unit will be visible to all units in the same region, no
      matter well-trained it is in stealth. This gives all other units one
      turn to react to the new situation. A guarding unit can also <a href=
      "orders.html#SIEGE">besiege</a> a castle in that region.</p>

      <p>More than one faction can guard a region simultaneously. In that
      case, only factions <a href="orders.html#HELP">allied</a> to all guarding factions
      can collect taxes, recruit new peasants or produce raw materials in this
      region.</p>

      <p>Note: Monsters (faction 0) are always regarded as being armed even
      if they do not carry visible weapons.</p>

      This order allows you to control how you support allied factions. The

    <dd>
      <tt>HIDE [level]</tt> tells a unit how hard it should try to hide from
      units of other factions. Of course, the specified level cannot exceed
      the unit's stealth skill level. If no level is given, the skill level
      is used. See the <a href="skills.html#stealth">chapter on the stealth
      skill</a> for more details.

      <p><tt>HIDE FACTION NUMBER faction-id</tt> makes a unit disguise as the
      specified faction. This disguise cannot be uncovered with normal
      means. To undo hiding you must use your own faction-id.</p>

      <p>The specified faction needs to appear in your report for this order
      to be effective.</p>

      <p>Heed the following peculiarities of this order:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>The race of a disguised unit remains unmodified. A goblin
        pretending to belong to the Wood-Elves faction still is a
        goblin.</li>

        <li>Disguised units behave as they would if not disguised. E.g. they
        do not donate silver to allies of the faction they disguise as. To
        perfect the disguise, form <a href="orders.html#GROUP">groups</a> with the
        appropriate help status.<br />
        The disguise does not give access to buildings or ships where it
        would be denied otherwise. The same is true for taxation.</li>

        <li>Disguised units form a seperate army during combat. Example:
        Assume there are three factions: the Wood Elves, the River Elves and
        the Iron Dwarfs. Each faction has one unit: Wood-Elf, River-Elf and
        Iron-Dwarf. While Wood-Elf pretends to belong to the River Elves, all
        other units do not disguise their faction.<br />
        Now Iron-Dwarf attacks the River Elves, i.e. River-Elf and Wood-Elf,
        who he believes to be one of the River Elves, too. Hence the battle
        report shows three armies: The Iron Dwarfes, the River Elves and an
        army that pretends be of the River Elves faction.<br />
        Thus, you can detect that a unit hides its faction, since there are
        two River Elves armies. The true faction identity of such units is
        not revealed, though.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><tt>HIDE FACTION</tt> makes a unit completely conceal which faction
      it belongs to. Only <a href="skills.html#espionage">espionage</a> can
      reveal the true identity of such a unit.</p>

      <p>With the <tt>HIDE race</tt> order, demon units can fake their race.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="LEARN" id="LEARN">LEARN</a>
    skill&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>With this order a unit spends one turn learning the specified skill.
    On average, a unit can reach skill level 1 after one turn. Getting to
    level 2 takes two turns and yet another 3 turns of learning result in
    skill level 3 and so forth. In most cases, a skill level of 2 is two
    times more effective than level 1 and level 3 three times more effective
    than level 1 etc. For more details see the <a href="skills.html">chapter
    on skills</a>. There is also a <a href="apendix_skills.html">description
    of every skill</a>. You might also want to look at the <a href=
    "orders.html#TEACH"><tt>TEACH</tt></a> order which is one way of increasing the
    speed of learning.</dd>

    <dt><a name="LEAVE" id="LEAVE">LEAVE</a></dt>

    <dd>
      A unit with this order leaves the ship or building it currently
      occupies. The <a href="orders.html#ENTER"><tt>ENTER</tt></a> and <a href=
      "orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a> order under certain circumstances force a
      unit to leave the occupied ship or building. Using the <tt>MOVE</tt>
      order on board a ship will either make the unit sail the ship to the
      indicated region (even if it is not an ocean region) or yield the error
      message that the unit is not the captain of the ship. In that case, the
      unit has to actively leave the ship before it can travel on land.

      <p>A unit leaving a ship can execute a <tt>MOVE</tt> order in the same
      turn only if it is allied with the faction guarding the region.
      Otherwise, <tt>MOVE</tt> works not before one turn later. Similarly, an
      <a href="orders.html#ATTACK"><tt>ATTACK</tt></a> can only take place in the next
      turn.</p>

      <p>Aquarians may leave their ships anchoring in a coastal ocean region
      and get on shore with the <tt>MOVE</tt> order. Obviously, they may only
      do so as long as they can carry all their items by themselves and
      neither own horses nor carts.</p>

      <p>When the owner of a ship or building leaves, the ownership is not
      necessarily passed on to the next unit in the report. You should use
      the <a href="orders.html#GIVE"><tt>GIVE CONTROL</tt></a> order to hand ownership
      of a ship or building to a certain unit when leaving it. It is
      guaranteed though, that if there is a unit of your faction in the same
      building or ship, it becomes the new owner.</p>

    <dd>
      <tt>MAKE</tt> is the basic order for production.

      <p>Items are fabricated via <tt>MAKE [amount] item</tt>. Depending on
      the item, the unit is required to have a certain skill and certain
      resources. If you do not specify an amount, the unit produces as many
      items as possible with the given skill level, number of persons and, if
      applicable, resources.</p>

      <p>For further reference, see the <a href=
      "production.html#items">production chapter</a>.</p>

      <p>You can optionally specify an amount when producing items, e.g. to
      conform to an arrangement about lumbering with one of your
      neigbours.</p><a name="MAKETEMP" id="MAKETEMP"></a>

      <p>With the <tt>MAKE TEMP</tt> order you can create a new unit. You
      assign this new unit a temporary alias since the actual id the unit
      will receive is unknown at that moment. The alias can be used in all
      other orders by prepending it with <tt>TEMP</tt>. Make sure to put
      persons into the new unit or it will not come into existence.</p>

      <p>If the alias is unoccupied the unit will receive it as its actual
      id. Also you can name the unit right away. Thus, the orders</p>
      <pre>
    MAKE TEMP 1
        NAME UNIT "Clowns"
        NUMBER UNIT jest
</pre>are equivalent to
      <pre>
    MAKE TEMP jest "Clowns"
</pre>

      <p>The amount of units in a faction is limited to 1000. If your faction
      exceeds 1000 units, the <tt>MAKE TEMP</tt> order becomes ineffective.
      To create new units you have to remove other units first, e.g. by
      merging them.</p>

      <p>Each <tt>MAKE TEMP</tt> order eventually has to be followed by the
      <a href="orders.html#END"><tt>END</tt></a> order. It separates the <tt>TEMP</tt>
      unit's orders from the orders of the parent unit.</p>

      <p>You can reference <tt>TEMP</tt> units of other factions in your
      orders as long as you yourself do not create a <tt>TEMP</tt> unit with
      the same alias as in the other faction. Therefore, accessing other
      factions' <tt>TEMP</tt> units requires some coordination.</p>

      <p>If you want a new unit to recruit persons (using the <a href=
      "orders.html#RECRUIT"><tt>RECRUIT</tt></a> order) you have to provide it with a
      sufficient amount of silver. Without it, recruiting fails and the new
      unit is not created. If there is enough silver but the unit does not
      recruit peasants, it is not created as well, its silver being lost to
      the peasants.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
  UNIT 17;       Fighter [15,700$]
    MAKE TEMP 1 "Dragon Slayer"
        LEARN melee
    END
    GIVE TEMP 1 5 MEN

    GIVE TEMP spy 100 silver
    MAKE TEMP spy
        RECRUIT 1
        NAME UNIT "Scout"
        DEFAULT "LEARN perception"
        MOVE West
    END
</pre>

      <p>The <tt>MAKE building-type</tt> order is used to erect new <a href=
      "buildings.html">buildings</a>. Units inside a building extend it when
      given the <tt>MAKE</tt> or <tt>MAKE building-type</tt> orders. When you
      want a unit to extend a building it does not occupy, the building id
      has to be specified in the <tt>MAKE buildingtype building-id</tt>
      order. Castles and most other buildings do not have a size limit. For a
      castle you need a unit with the masonry skill and stones. Wood, iron
      and silver in <a href="appendix.html#buildings">various amounts</a> is
      required for the other buildings.</p>

      <p><tt>MAKE shiptype</tt> starts the construction of a <a href=
      "production.html#ships">new ship</a>. Ships cannot be extended like
      castles; instead, the type of the ship is specified at the beginning of
      construction. Being inside a ship, its construction can be continued
      with the <tt>MAKE</tt> or <tt>MAKE SHIP</tt> orders. Units not on board
      the ship have to use the <tt>MAKE SHIP ship-id</tt> order. Ships have a
      limited size depending on their type and they cannot be expanded beyond
      this limit. To build a ship, wood and the shipcraft skill are
      required.</p>

      <p>Construction of both buildings and ships can be limited to a certain
      number of levels per round by specifying this number in the
      <tt>MAKE</tt> order. This is very useful in connection with the
      <a href="income.html#pools">item pool</a>.</p>

      <blockquote>
        Example:<br />
        turn one - <tt>MAKE LONGBOAT</tt><br />
        A new ship is constructed and is gets 76 assigned as its id.<br />
        turn two - <tt>MAKE SHIP 76</tt><br />
        The construction of ship 76 is being continued
      </blockquote>

      <p>To ease travelling in a region by building streets and bridges, you
      can use the <tt>MAKE ROAD direction</tt> order. Building roads requires
      the roadwork skill and stones. For more details, see the <a href=
      "production.html#roads">production chapter</a>.</p>

      <p>The production of potions can only be carried out by highly skilled
      alchemists. For more details see the <a href="alchemy.html">alchemy

      Using these orders, you can send a message to foreign units, other

      only if the renaming unit is their owner, i.e. if it appears directly
      under the object in your report. A region can be renamed by the lord of
      the biggest castle in that region only.

      <p>The new name can be up to 80 characters long and mustn't contain

      <p><tt>SILVERPOOL</tt>: Usually units have to pay any expenses from
      their own silver. With this option enabled, necessary silver is also
      taken from other units in the region (also see the <a href=
      "income.html#pools">income chapter</a>).</p>

      <p><tt>ITEMPOOL</tt>: The item pool is the equivalent of the silver
      pool for items (also see the <a href="income.html#pools">income

    <dt><a name="ORIGIN" id="ORIGIN">ORIGIN</a> x y</dt>

    <dt><a name="PASSWORD" id="PASSWORD">PASSWORD</a> "new password"</dt>

    <dd>
      This order sets a new password which is to be used in the <a href=
      "orders.html#ERESSEA"><tt>ERESSEA</tt></a> order from the next turn on. A password
      must consist only of letters and digits. A password containing invalid
      characters is rejected; nevertheless, the faction receives a new
      randomly generated password instead.

      <p>Example: It's die zweite Woche of the month of Herdfeuer:</p>
      <pre>
    ERESSEA 11 "oldpassword"
        PASSWORD "wrong" ; no effect
        UNIT 75
            PASSWORD "MoftZga" ; to be used from next turn on
            [...]
</pre>

      <p>It's die letzte Woche of the month of Herdfeuer:</p>
      <pre>
    ERESSEA 11 "MoftZga"
        [...]
</pre>

      <p>New factions initially get a random password.</p>

      <p>Caution:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>In contrast to the rest of the orders, the password is
        case-sensitive.</li>

        <li>The password order has to be issued by a unit.</li>

        <li>A order file has to contain either the same password as in the
        previous turn or the one that was set in the previous turn.<br />
        The password of the previous turn is valid even if multiple order
        files have been submitted for the current turn, which contain the
        <tt>PASSWORD</tt> order with differing passwords.</li>

        <li>The password is only changed successfully if you receive the
        according message in your next turn's report.</li>

    <dt><a name="PIRACY" id="PIRACY">PIRACY</a> [faction-id [faction-id
    [...]]]</dt>

    <dd>With this order, a ship's captain starts waylaying ships that end
    their movement phase in a neighbouring region. If such a ship arrives, he
    automatically sails there. Only ships of the specified factions trigger
    this reaction. If no faction is specified, the captain waylays all ships
    of factions which his own faction has not set the <a href=
    "orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP COMBAT</tt></a> status for. See the <a href=
    "combat.html#piracy">piracy chapter</a> for more details.</dd>

    <dt><a name="PLANT" id="PLANT">PLANT</a>
    [amount] SEED / "MALLORN SEED"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;<br />
    PLANT [amount] HERBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

      <p>Using the PLANT SEED order the unit tries to plant the number of seeds but
      only one seed per skill level. In mallorn regions you can only plant mallorn
      seeds. You need a herbalism skill level of 6 to plant seed and a level of 7
      to plant mallorn seed.</p>

      <p>The <tt>PLANT HERBS</tt> order demands a minimum skill level of six
      in herbalism. The unit tries to plant one herb per skill level; it needs
      a corresponding amount of the appropriate type of herb as well as a
      vial of the water of life. You cannot plant a different kind of herb than the
      one originally found in the region.</p>

    <dt><a name="PREFIX" id="PREFIX">PREFIX</a> [prefix]</dt>

    <dd>
      This order allows you to prepend the race name of your faction's units
      with a prefix. The prefix has no other side effects. If no prefix is
      specified in the order, an existing race name prefix is removed.

      <p>Currently, these prefixes are available: <em>dark, light, gully,
      high, hill, mountain, wood, swamp, snow, sun, moon, sea, valley,
      shadow, cave, blood, wild, chaos, night, mist, grey, cold, gloom,
      black.</em></p>

      <p>The <tt>PREFIX</tt> order can be used for the whole faction or for a
      <a href="orders.html#GROUP">group</a>. Thus, you can assign different prefixes to
      different groups in your faction.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="PROMOTION" id="PROMOTION">PROMOTION</a></dt>

    <dd>
      This order promotes a unit to heroes.

      <p>Hero units will have ten attacks instead of one. This only
      applies to weapons that do not need several rounds to reload, not
      to magic, catapults and crossbows which require multiple rounds.</p>

      <p>The cost (in silver) of promoting one person to the status of
      hero is equivalent to the number of people in your faction. E.g.,
      if you have 1200 people, then promoting a 4-person unit will cost
      4800 silver. In the order of commands, the PROMOTION command is
      executed just before the NUMBER command.</p>

      <p>Hero units cannot mix their people with non-hero units and heroes
      cannot be given to other factions.</p>

      <p>No faction can have more than log10(persons/50)*20 heroes.</p>

    </dd>

    <dt><a name="QUIT" id="QUIT">QUIT</a> "Passwort"</dt>

    <dd>
      Causes a faction to quit and leave the game. For safety reasons, you
      have to supply your faction password.

      <p>This order has to be issued by a unit:</p>
      <pre>
    ERESSEA 27 "FumbleBatz"
        UNIT 80
            QUIT "FumbleBatz"
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="RECRUIT" id="RECRUIT">RECRUIT</a> amount</dt>

    <dd>
      Hires new men for your faction from the peasants in the region.
      Depending on your faction's race, you have to invest a certain amount
      of silver per recruited person (see the <a href=
      "races.html#modifiers">modifiers table</a> for further detail). The
      unit carrying out the <tt>RECRUIT</tt> order has to hold the necessary
      silver. If a new unit is created, it cannot recruit men unless a
      sufficient amount of silver is given to it.

      <p>You can only hire new persons of your faction's race. Units composed
      of immigrants in a human faction cannot recruit more immigrants.</p>

      <p>When an exisiting unit hires new men its skills are diluted since
      the new persons do not have any skills. The original skill levels are
      distributed among all persons in the unit after recruiting.</p>

      <p>Recruitment does not prevent other long orders from being carried
      out.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 42
        RECRUIT 10
        LEARN melee
        GIVE TEMP 4 100 silver
        MAKE TEMP 4
            RECRUIT 2
            LEARN quarrying
        END
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="REGION" id="REGION">REGION</a> x,y</dt>

    <dd>REGION orders are optional. They are put into the order template
    simply for reference, and to help order-checking tools distinguish units
    in different regions.</dd>

    <dt><a name="RESEARCH" id="RESEARCH">RESEARCH</a>
    HERBS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>The unit tries to find out which herb is growing in the region and
    how many plants are still growing there. Your unit needs a skill level of
    7 or higher in herbalism to be able to execute this order.</dd>

    <dt><a name="RESERVE" id="RESERVE">RESERVE</a> amount item<br /></dt>

    <dd>
      With this order a unit can grab and retain items and silver from other
      units in the same region. Note that the requested items are taken from
      any unit (usually from top to bottom in the list of units in the orders
      template) as long as these units do not reserve the items themselves.

      <p><tt>RESERVE</tt> only becomes effective when the <a href=
      "income.html#pools">item pool</a> or respectively the <a href=
      "income.html#pools">silver pool</a> is activated.</p>

      <p>Caution! TEMP units cannot reserve items or silver. All they need
      has to be transferred to them via the <a href="orders.html#GIVE"><tt>GIVE</tt></a>
      order.</p>

      <p>All items a unit receives via the <a href="orders.html#GIVE"><tt>GIVE</tt></a>
      order cannot be taken from it by another unit with the <tt>RESERVE</tt>
      order (also see the <a href="income.html#pools">chapter on
      pools</a>).</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="RESTART" id="RESTART">RESTART</a> race "password"</dt>

    <dd>
      <p>Allows to give up a faction and immediately start with a new one
      with another race if your faction is older than 81 turns. Your
      magic school stays the same.</p>

      <p>The new faction sets out in the region where the <tt>RESTART</tt>
      order is issued. This region must neither be an ocean nor of any other
      non-standard terrain. Apart from these restrictions, the same rules
      apply for restarted and 'real' new factions.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="RIDE" id="RIDE">RIDE</a>
    unit-id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Your unit will join a carrier unit. The transporting unit has to
      explicitely <a href="orders.html#CARRY">carry</a> the unit needing a ride. This
      allows units to travel by horse or cart without the riding skill.

      <p>Example:<br />
      Faction 125:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 311
        RIDE 456 ; I'd like to ride on your cart!
        CONTACT 456
        [...]
</pre>

      <p>Faction 300:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 456
        CARRY 311 ; Ok, climb up!
        CONTACT 311
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="ROUTE" id="ROUTE">ROUTE</a> direction [direction
    [etc.]]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Given this order, a unit travels through the world of Eressea just like
      with the <a href="orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a> order.

      <p>Additionally, you can establish a circular route, so a unit travels
      continuously between two or more regions. All directions that were
      successfully travelled in one turn are taken from the head of the
      direction list and appended at its end.</p>

      <p>To skip steps in the movement phase (e.g. to halt a ship in a region
      though it could actually travel farther in one turn) use the
      <tt>PAUSE</tt> keyword (abbr.: <tt>P</tt>). If a unit halts at the end
      of its movement phase and the movement phase of the next turn starts
      with one or more <tt>PAUSE</tt>s, they are put at the end of the
      direction list so the movement phase of the next turn does begin with a
      real direction.</p>

      <blockquote>
        A unit on horseback travels three regions per turn on roads. It has
        the following <tt>ROUTE</tt> order:
        <pre>
    ROUTE ne east pause east east se west west pause sw west nw
</pre>In the next turn the order looks like this:
        <pre>
    ROUTE east east se west west pause sw west nw ne east pause
</pre>And in the next turn:
        <pre>
    ROUTE west west pause se west nw no east pause east east so
</pre>And again in the next turn:
        <pre>
    ROUTE sw west nw ne east pause east east se west west pause
</pre>In the next turn the order looks like in the first turn.

    <dt><a name="SABOTAGE" id="SABOTAGE">SABOTAGE</a>
    SHIP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>Using this order, a spy can try to sink the ship he's on. See the
    <a href="skills#espionage">chapter on espionage</a> for more
    details.</dd>

    <dt><a name="SELL" id="SELL">SELL</a> amount
    luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;(L)&gt;<br />
    SELL ALL luxury&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;(L)&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      A unit skilled in trade can use this order to sell the luxury items it
      owns to the peasants. As a presupposition, a tradepost needs to be
      erected in the region and there needs to be a demand for the luxury
      good. Trade does not require the permission of the local sovereign but
      it might be more diplomatic to request it, nevertheless.

      <p>When on board a ship in a <a href="orders.html#GUARD">guarded</a> region you
      can trade only if you are either <a href="alliances.html">allied</a>
      with the guarding factions or they <a href="orders.html#CONTACT">contact</a> your
      merchant.</p>

      <p>For further reference, see the <a href="income.html#trade">trade
      chapter</a>.</p>

      <p><tt>SELL ALL</tt> automatically sells the amount of the luxury item
      that is demanded in the region. This will also work if more than one
      faction gives this order, or if somebody in the region is recruiting.</p>

      <p><tt>SELL</tt> is a pseudo-long order, just like <tt><a href=
      "orders.html#BUY">BUY</a></tt>. You can combine both and trade at most
      skill-level(trade) × 10 luxury items per turn but issue no other long
      order.</p>

      <p><tt>BUY</tt> and <tt>SELL</tt> do not appear in the standard report,
      so it looks as though merchant units had no default order. But this is
      only to prevent a long list of orders in the report. The computer
      report and the orders template show these orders only if you add the @
      prefix to them.</p>
    </dd>

    SHOW ALL SPELLS<br />
    SHOW ALL POTIONS</dt>

    <dd>If you need to see the description for a spell, a special item or a
    potion, let one of your units issue a SHOW order and you will get the
    information with next turn's report. Make sure the unit using the order
    owns the item and knows the spell or how to make the potion.</dd>

    <dt><a name="SIEGE" id="SIEGE">SIEGE</a> building-id &lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      With this order you can lay siege to a castle. All contact to the outer
      world is prevented, but a unit with a high skill level in stealth might
      be able to sneak into and out of the besieged castle. The units in the
      castle cannot get silver from the outside and will starve to death, if
      they are not able to break the siege in time. The besiegers fire their
      catapults each turn and by this gradually destroy the castle.

      <p>Only guarding units can besiege a castle. To besiege a castle you
      must be able to control the inhabitants at least as well as if you want
      to guard. Additionally, foreign units are given one turn to react
      appropriately on this new situation.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="SORT" id="SORT">SORT</a> BEFORE unit-id<br />
    SORT AFTER unit-id</dt>

    <dd>
      This allows you to change how units are sorted in the report and in the
      orders template. For example, you could put pupils right after their
      teacher.

      <p>Mark the following restrictions:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>unit-id has to specify one of your own units.</li>

        <li>The order imposed by units being inside or outside buildings and
        ships overrides the <tt>SORT</tt> order. To be effective, all
        re-sorted units have to be inside the same building or ship or none
        at all.</li>

        <li>A unit cannot be sorted before an owner of a building or
        ship.</li>

        <li>The order is ineffective for owners of buildings or ships.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The order of units is modified at the very end of a turn. Therefore,
      you can re-sort units in the turn they reach a region via one of the
      movement orders.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="SPY" id="SPY">SPY</a>
    unit-id&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      With espionage you can spy on units of other factions. To determine the
      success of the espionage the spy's espioange skill level is compared
      with the perception skill level of the target unit.

      <p>With a base chance of 10% you can learn something about the target
      unit. Your chances increase by 5% for each skill level by which the
      spy's espionage skill level exceeds the target unit's perception skill
      level.</p>

      <p>If the spy is successful, he learns some random type of information
      from the victim. He might find out about the target unit's combat
      status, its items, a single skill or the true faction it belongs
      to.</p>

      <p>The true faction identity can only be determined if the spy is
      skilled at least 6 levels better in espionage than the victim in
      perception. All other information can be learned with a standard
      espionage success.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the following formula is used to determine whether the
      victim notices the espionage: (100 - espionage(spy) x 5 +
      perception(victim) x 2)%</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="STEAL" id="STEAL">STEAL</a> unit-id &lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Using this order your unit will try to steal from the specified one. If
      the offender's stealth skill is higher than the victim's perception
      (which means the perception skill of the best unit in the region) the
      victim only notices that it has been robbed. The offender steals 50
      silver for each man and skill level difference.

      <p>If the offender's stealth is equal to the victim's perception the
      theft fails and the victim becomes suspicious. If the victim's
      perception is even superior to the offender's stealth the offending
      unit is catched red-handed and identified.</p>

      <p>But beware, the thief always steals with his victim's silver pool
      activated, even when the other player does not use the pool feature.
      Doing this he can also steal from other units which have not been the
      target of his order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="TAX" id="TAX">TAX</a>
    [amount]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Given this order, a unit collects taxes from the peasants in the
      region. The unit has to be equipped with a weapon and be skilled in the
      corresponding weapon skill as well as in taxation. It can earn up to 20
      pieces of silver per person and skill level; catapults cannot be used
      for this task. You can optionally specify a maximum amount of silver to
      be collected.

      <p>If more than one faction tries to tax the peasants of a region the
      silver is divided up proportionally. To prevent other factions from
      collecting taxes in a region use the <a href=
      "orders.html#GUARD"><tt>GUARD</tt></a> order.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="TEACH" id="TEACH">TEACH</a> unit-id [unit-id
    etc.]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      To reduce the time required to learn a skill, a unit can be taught by
      another unit. This requires that the teacher is at least two levels
      better than the pupil in the relevant skill. The pupil learns twice as
      fast as without teaching

      <p>The units specified in the <tt>TEACH</tt> order all need to give a
      <a href="orders.html#LEARN"><tt>LEARN</tt></a> order and each teacher can teach up
      to 10 students at a time. It is not necessary to specify the skill you
      want to teach, since the students already specify this in their
      <tt>LEARN</tt> orders. In fact, it's possible for a teacher to teach
      different skills to his students at the same time.</p>

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 78
      TEACH 54 67 TEMP 2 68
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="UNIT" id="UNIT">UNIT</a> unit-id</dt>

    <dd>
      This order starts the order-block for one of your units.

      <p>Example:</p>
      <pre>
    UNIT 45
        MOVE West
    UNIT 46
        ENTER CASTLE 7
        WORK
</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt><a name="USE" id="USE">USE</a> [amount] "item"</dt>

    <dd>Use the specified item, usually a <a href=
    "alchemy.html#potions">potion</a>. A unit cannot use different potions in
    one turn but it is possible to use several potions of the same type to
    extend their effect on more than 10 men. The effect of a potion usually
    stops at the end of the turn and surplus portions of it are wasted.</dd>

    <dt><a name="WORK" id="WORK">WORK</a> &lt;L&gt;</dt>

    <dd>
      Tells the unit to do manual labor, working in agriculture or fishing.
      It will produce enough silver to survive, but little more. The exact
      salary depends on the size of the biggest local fortification. Orcs
      will earn less than others. A unit aboard a landed ship cannot work if
      the region is guarded by a faction that is not allied with it.

      Unlike the comment made with a ; (semicolon), this comment will be
      sticky, and survives through the evaluation of the turn. It can be
      useful to comment long-term plans for a unit.

      The // comment is handled like an order and needs to be on a separate
      line. Thus, the following is not legal:
      <pre>
    @GIVE 345 100 silver // for sawmill

    </dd>

  <h2><a name="sample" id="sample">Sample Turn</a></h2>

  <p>An extended version of these orders was actually the first turn of a
  real faction. It might not be the best way to start, though. Note that all
  orders exceeding one line are augmented with a \ (backslash) at the line
  break.</p>
