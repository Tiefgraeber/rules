  <h1>Mail</h1>

  <h2><a name="addresses" id="addresses">Useful Addresses</a></h2>

  <p>If you have any questions regarding the game, you can ask the good folks
  at <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de?subject=Frage">eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>
  for help. These are players helping us out with the support work, and they
  are extremely knowledgeable and quick to respond.</p>

  <p>All automated Mail goes to the eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de address.
  There are a couple of operations that you can trigger by using the right
  subject in your emails:</p>

  <div align="center"></div>

  <div align="center"></div>

  <h2>Sending in orders</h2>

  <p>To send in orders, use the subject <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de?subject=ERESSEA%20ORDERS">ERESSEA
  ORDERS</a> in your mail, and put the orders in the body of your email.</p>

  <h2>Requesting your password</h2>

  <p>If you've forgotten your password, simply send an email to the server
  with the subject <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de?subject=ERESSEA%20PASSWORD%20faction">
  ERESSEA PASSWORD faction</a><br />
  and your password will be sent to the address that your report is usually
  sent to. <a name="INDEX-Report_nachfordern" id=
  "INDEX-Report_nachfordern"></a></p>

  <h2>Requesting the report manually</h2>

  <p>If for whatever reasons you have not received or have lost your report,
  or want to retrieve it from another address, send an email to the server
  with the subject <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-server@eressea.kn-bremen.de?subject=ERESSEA%20REPORT%20faction%20%22password%22">
  ERESSEA REPORT faction "password"</a> (filling in your own faction and
  password of course), and your report will be sent to the address that the
  request came from.<br /></p>

  <h2>Mailing lists</h2>

  <p>There are two mailing lists which are hosted by Google.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><b><tt>Eressea-RPG</tt></b></dt>

    <dd>Under <a href="/web/20070803082253/http://groups.google.com/group/eressea-rpg">
    http://groups.google.com/group/eressea-rpg</a> is the
    Eressea-<b>R</b>ole<b>P</b>lay<b>G</b>ame list. This is a strictly
    in-character list, where the faction leaders debate, though mostly
    in German.</dd>

    <dt><b><tt>Eressea-Client</tt></b></dt>

    <dd>Under <a href="/web/20070803082253/http://groups.google.com/group/eressea-client">
    http://groups.google.com/group/eressea-client</a> are discussions about
    miscellaneous client software and how to write your own.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>If you want to participate, you can register there. You must use the
  address which is used for registration to write and send articles.</p>

  <p>An additional list is <b><tt>eressea-announce-en</tt></b> where you can
  only read but not write. You need not to register for this list. As long as
  you are playing Eressea, you will automatically be subscribed to this list
  with the email address of your faction. Mail sent this list contains information
  about the game, rule changes and other GM announcements.</p>

  <p>If you want to chat with other Eressea players, you can do so on
  the IRC channel <tt>#eressea</tt> (on IRCnet), or ask questions about
  the rules on the channel <tt>#e-help</tt>. To connect, you can use
  software such as xchat, mIRC or ChatZilla.
