  <h1>Advice for Beginners</h1>

  <h2>Keep your Password Secret</h2>

  <p>There have been several occasions in the past when careless players lost
  their factions because another player submitted a <tt>QUIT</tt> order in
  their name. This can only happen if you give away your password. You should
  never give the password to anyone, not even your allies, and you should
  change it on a regular basis. Nothing is worse than losing two years of
  empire-building to something like this.</p>

  <h2>Eressea is a Fantasy Game</h2>

  <p>While there are many players that play Eressea simply for the strategic
  aspects, the majority does a good deal of socializing and roleplaying. Try
  adding some atmosphere to the world, or at least don't break the atmosphere
  intentionally. Names like "Cyborg Elves" are out of place in Eressea.</p>

  <h2>How to Get Gelp</h2>

  <p>If you have problems when writing your first orders or if you don't
  understand why something happened, you can be helped. E-mails to <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de">eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>
  are answered by a team of volunteers. Almost everyone makes a mistake in
  the beginning. Even experienced players have lost half their resources in
  an initial blunder and recovered. Don't be discouraged if something goes
  wrong.</p>

  <h2>Use ECheck</h2>

  <p>ECheck is a little tool that checks your orders for 'grammatical'
  correctness. When submitting orders you get an automated reply with a very
  simple syntactical check. By installing ECheck at home the checks can be
  much more thorough. Be warned, sometimes ECheck accepts/rejects orders the
  server doesn't and the server may not be using the most recent version.
  ECheck was not written by the creators of Eressea and is not always
  perfect.</p>

  <h2>Comment Your Orders</h2>

  <p>There are two forms of comments; persistent comments beginning with
  <tt>//</tt> (two slashes) 'survive' a turn, i.e. your next turn's report
  still contains them. Temporary comments starting with <tt>;</tt> (a
  semicolon) are discarded by the Eressea server. Persistent comments in your
  orders can help you to remember why you did something or what you want to
  do next week. They can also be very helpful if you're on vacation and
  someone else is taking care of your faction.</p>
  <pre>
REGION 4,4 ; Lochinver
; remember to recruit a magician before sending this in
UNIT zbt ; Ezra, 2 elves
MAKE swords
GIVE sjur 5 swords
// next turn, make spears for 45zt
</pre>

  <h2>What You Should Do in the First Few Weeks</h2>

  <p>Your first goal should be to explore your immediate surroundings and
  find out who your neighbors are. Look for the important resources, stake
  your claims, and get in touch with the other players. When sending out
  scouts, make sure they have enough money to survive but not so much that
  they cannot move. If the scouting unit needs to recruit, remember that it
  uses some of the money that you give it to pay the recruitment.</p>

  <p>You should also start to create an infrastructure. Try getting a regular
  income either through entertainment or taxation; they are the easiest forms
  of making money. Working is not, and you cannot trade before you have at
  least two regions with some form of castle. Aim at getting your first armed
  units. There are some skills that may not seem important at the beginning
  but you should nevertheless try to learn them as soon as possible -
  perception and tactics are two of them often neglected by beginners.</p>

  <p>Keep an eye on the expenses to supply your units with food. Large units
  need huge sums of silver to survive and if they do not have it they will
  starve. You need only one unit with the sufficient amount of silver, it
  will give as much to your other units as they need to survive. However,
  remember that your startup money is meant to be invested. Only by spending
  it your faction can grow and your units improve their abilities. If you
  save more than you need to, you will gradually fall behind.</p>

  <h2>There is no 'Winner'</h2>

  <p>The open-ended nature of Eressea ensures that the game cannot be won by
  a single player. There is not even a goal that you should achieve other
  than enjoying the game. Even so it is possible to lose. A warmonger may
  wipe you out, powerful monsters might threaten your people, and you might
  consider giving up. The history of Eressea is filled with such defeats. But
  there are also inspiring stories of people who did not give up even in the
  grimmest situations. Some chose exile and shipped the last of their units
  into a new land, rebuilding what they lost, finding new allies and
  occasionally triumphing after many years. There is probably nothing that is
  more rewarding than making such a comeback. Don't give up lightly. After
  all, it is just a game.</p>

  <h2>Submitting Orders</h2>

  <p>The easiest way to write orders is to use the order template at the end
  of your report. It lists all your units with their default orders and you
  simply replace these with the orders you would like them to execute in the
  coming turn. Simply cut and paste the template from the report, edit the
  orders, and mail the result back to the game server.</p>

  <p>While there is no official graphical interface for Eressea, several have
  been created by dedicated players. At the time of this writing, Magellan
  and EMap are by far the most popular of them, each boasting a user base of
  several hundred. We recommend that you give them a try.</p>

  <p>Except for your password, the orders are case-insensitive. Names that
  include spaces must be quoted. Some examples:</p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><tt>NAME SHIP "Titanic II"<br />
  USE "Great Amulet of the Chickenpox"<br />
  LEARN "Unarmed Combat"</tt></font></p>

  <h2><a name="longshortorders" id="longshortorders">Long and short
  orders</a></h2>

  <p>There are two fundamental types of orders. Long orders take an entire
  turn to complete, and your unit can only perform one of them during a turn.
  Short orders are instantaneous, and any number of them can be issued.</p>

  <p><a name="INDEX-Befehle!Lange"></a>The long orders are:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>
    <a href="orders.html#BUY"><tt>BUY</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#CAST"><tt>CAST</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#ENTERTAIN"><tt>ENTERTAIN</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#FOLLOW"><tt>FOLLLOW</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#GROW"><tt>GROW</tt></a>.
    <a href="orders.html#LEARN"><tt>LEARN</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE</tt></a> (except <tt>MAKE TEMP</tt>),
    <a href="orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#PLANT"><tt>PLANT</tt></a>.
    <a href="orders.html#RESEARCH"><tt>RESEARCH</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#RIDE"><tt>RIDE</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#ROUTE"><tt>ROUTE</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#SELL"><tt>SELL</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#SIEGE"><tt>SIEGE</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#SPY"><tt>SPY</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#STEAL"><tt>STEAL</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#TAX"><tt>TAX</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#TEACH"><tt>TEACH</tt></a>,
    <a href="orders.html#WORK"><tt>WORK</tt></a>,
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If a unit receives a long order, this order will become its persistent
  default order for the next turn. Your order template for the next week will
  show it. The only exception to this is MOVE.</p>

  <h2>How to make short orders persistent using @</h2>

  <p>Sometimes giving the same short order continuously makes sense even for
  short orders. A weaponsmith might want to always give the swords he made to
  another unit using a GIVE order. This can be achieved by prefixing the
  order with a @ character. The order <font face="Times New Roman"><tt>@GIVE
  trsp 100 sword</tt></font> for example would become a persistent order that
  reappears in your order template every week.</p>
