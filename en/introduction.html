  Empires and Legends</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>Eressea is a fantasy world. Elves, dwarves, orcs and other races live
  among its shores, dragons and sea serpents terrorize its population, and
  powerful magic is part of everyday life.</p>

  <p>Eressea is a gigantic world. Thousands of little kingdoms and clans,
  mighty empires and trade unions are spread over numerous continents and
  islands. Most of them you may never meet in your life. But you will hear
  many legends of both victory and defeat, joy and tragedy from far-off
  places.</p>

  <p>Eressea is a complex world. To be successful, there is much you must do
  and understand. You will forge alliances, establish trade routes, and build
  mighty fortresses. Sometimes your neighbors may just not like you and
  declare war. But if all goes well, your people can develop and expand for
  ages to come. At the beginning, playing Eressea takes well under an hour a
  week. But after several months or even years of playing, the leaders of
  large factions often need 10 hours for a turn, sometimes more.</p>

  <p>There is no defined goal, no final victory in Eressea. Your goals in
  life are entirely up to you, whether you want to explore the world, build a
  trading fleet, conquer and expand, or simply socialize with other
  players.</p>

  <p>Each player is the leader of one faction of people in Eressea, all of
  which belong to one (and only one) of the eleven available races. You can
  start playing at any time, even after the game has been going for years,
  and the first person of your new family will be set into a new piece of
  land, usually close to others as young as you. From then on, it's all up to
  you.</p>

  <h2>Under Construction!</h2>

  <p>These are the English translated rules for Eressea. They are currently
  under development and the English version of the game is not yet finished.
  There may be discrepancies between these rules and the actual game. If you
  spot any, please let us know immediately.</p>
