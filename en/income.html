  <h1>Silver</h1>

  <p>Money makes the world go round; even in Eressea. Many different ways to
  earn money exist in Eressea: You can earn money by working, entertaining
  the peasants, collecting taxes, trading, or even theft.</p>

  <p>Working is more of a type of stopgap, units working will earn barely
  enough to feed themselves. You can make quite a lot of money with
  entertainment and taxation. Especially at the beginning of your ventures,
  trading might be the biggest source of income, profits of some thousands of
  silver are possible! Silver has its own weight: each 100 pieces of silver
  equal one unit of weight (UW). When calculating weight it is a common rule
  to round up; even one piece of silver can be too much.</p>

  <p>Because persons (of most <a href="races.html#profiles">races</a>) can
  carry 5.4 units of weight, they can carry up to 540 silver with them; when
  carrying 541 silver a single person is overloaded. A boat (50 UWs capacity)
  for example, can carry one person (10 UWs in most cases) with 4000 silver;
  even 4001 silver would be too much.</p>

  <h2><a name="expenses" id="expenses">Expenses: food, maintenance
  recruitment costs</a></h2>

  <p>Every person of a faction and each peasant require 10 silver each turn
  to buy themselves the supplies needed to survive. Units of a faction help
  each other with silver when staying in the same region, i.e. it is
  basically enough if one unit has enough silver for all persons present
  (which can lead to catastrophes when done wrong and nobody else has any
  silver!). Units which move have to be suplied where they will arrive.
  Usually this is done by having the moving unit carry enough silver to feed
  itself.</p>

  <p><a name="starvation" id="starvation"></a>Without enough silver, units
  will suffer from hunger. Each starving unit is damaged by between 13 and 24
  points of damage. Halflings are an exception: these greedy small folk
  suffer between 15 and 28 points of damage whenever there is nothing for
  dinner. If a person is damaged more than it has hitpoints, it will die. A
  starving unit is not able to do anything besides WORK, and it cannot give
  persons to other units. (Exception to that are <a href=
  "races.html#Demonhunger">Demons</a>.) Finally, the skill levels of starving
  units are reduced by half (i. e. the effective level of skill is reduced by
  half, rounded down).</p>

  <p>Even some buildings require weekly maintenance costs in order to
  function and not collapse. These maintenance costs are due at the start of
  each turn, they must be collected the turn before and are due as soon as
  the construction of the building has started (so it's the same with
  unfinished buildings). If there is not enough money, the building will not
  function. If there is enough money by the end of the turn, the building
  will be protected from collapsing at least. More information on buildings
  can be found <a href="buildings.html">here</a>.</p>

  <p>If you want to recruit persons, you will not need anything more than
  some silver, because the peasants to be recruited are often especially
  hungry and thirsty. For each person that is going to be recruited you must
  to pay them between 40 and 150 silver per person. The exact cost depends
  upon the faction's race, more information can be found in the <a href=
  "races.html">races chapter</a>.</p>

  <p>If a region is guarded by a foreign faction, that has neither set HELP
  GUARD nor HELP ALL for your faction, you cannot recruit any new persons in
  that region. There is one exception to this: if your STEALTH exceeds the
  PERCEPTION of the guarding faction you can recruit new persons. Newly
  created (empty) TEMP-Units can recruit new persons if the unit issuing the
  MAKE TEMP command is 'invisible' to the guarding faction.</p>

  <p>You can only recruit persons of your own race! Persons from foreign
  races can only be admitted to human factions and they have to be given to
  them by other factions.</p>

  <h2><a name="income" id="income">Income: work, entertainment and collecting
  taxes</a></h2>

  <p>You can earn money by working in the agricultural sector (see the WORK
  order). However, the bigger the forests in a region are, the smaller the
  area that can be used for farming, and the smaller amount of peasants (and
  player units) which are able to work: for each tree, eight peasants or
  persons in a unit are not able to work in that region (for each young tree:
  4). How many persons can work in a region (i.e. without any woods) depends
  on the type of region. For more information, look at the <a href=
  "orders.html#WORK">WORK</a> order.</p>

  <p>Normally, a peasant earns 11 silver each turn. This wage may be
  increased by a castle bonus. A fully constructed citadel raises the wage up
  to 16 silver for each peasant per turn. See this <a href=
  "production.html#CASTLES">table</a> for a chart detailing the effects of
  castles upon local production. If, for instance, a citadel has been built
  in a plain and all the trees are cut down, 10000 peasants are able to
  supply themselves and another 6000 persons.</p>

  <p>However, the player controlled units earn less; in the end they are just
  unskilled workers. How much they are able to earn can be seen in the
  report. You can determine how much your units will earn by WORKING by
  looking at this table for the <a href="orders.html#WORK">WORK</a>
  order.</p>

  <p>Armed and trained henchmen can squeeze 20 silver out of the peasants for
  each man and skill level of taxation. For example, 6 men with level 3
  taxation can earn a total of 360 silver a turn if there is that much money
  left to be taxed in a region. In order to tax, the unit needs the taxation
  skill, weapons, and the corresponding weapon skills (i.e. melee, polearm,
  bow, or crossbow).</p>

  <p>Similarly, each faction can guard a region. If a unit is issued a
  <a href="orders.html#GUARD">GUARD</a> order it will guard the region the
  next turn. Guarding units are instantly visible to everyone. They prevent
  other factions from collecting taxes. Other factions may be allowed to tax
  a region if the GUARDing unit has also issued a <a href=
  "orders.html#HELP">HELP GUARD</a> order to allow the specified factions to
  tax.</p>

  <p>If a region is being guarded by more than one faction, only the factions
  that received HELP GUARD from the guarding factions can collect taxes.</p>

  <p>If the number of peasants in a region is close to the maximum capacity,
  the silver reserves in the region are going to be needed to support and
  feed the peasants. This leaves no silver available to be taxed, the
  population is already struggling to support itself. Units may still tax,
  but this causes peasants to starve to death, reducing the amount of silver
  produced next turn. In this situation, it is extremely useful to build a
  castle in order to raise the efficiency and wages of the local peasants. A
  wage increase of only +1 (i.e. to 12 silver per peasant) would cause 2,000
  peasants to earn an additional 2,000 silver for you to tax.</p>

  <p>The silver that remains after feeding and paying taxing units is then
  available for entertainment. Up to 5% of this remaining silver can be be
  earned by entertainers using the <a href=
  "orders.html#ENTERTAIN"><tt>ENTERTAIN</tt></a> order. Each entertainer can
  earn up to 20 silver per skill level in entertainment.</p>

  <p>In the last example, the total income is smaller because not all the
  peasants can work. This is because too many trees are preventing them from
  growing food.</p>

  <p>The chart also does not take into consideration the peasants' savings.
  They will live on these savings when overpopulation strikes. The silver
  available for entertainment are also affected by the amount of savings the
  peasantry has.</p>

  <p>In your reports, these savings appear in the region's description after
  the amount the of peasants. This silver can be collected via taxation
  without any danger of starving the peasantry. However, peasants will
  emigrate to neighboring regions when those regions are richer.</p>

  <h2><a name="theft" id="theft">Theft &amp; Stealing</a></h2>

  <p>There is a dishonest way to earn silver as well: theft. Units which are
  disguised can try to steal silver from other units.</p>

  <p>If the stealth skill level of the thief is higher than the best
  perception skill level of target's faction in the region, the thief will
  steal 50 silver for each level of difference. In this case, the stolen
  silver comes from the whole silver pool of the target faction in that
  region, even if the faction doesn't have the <a href=
  "orders.html#OPTION">OPTION SILVERPOOL</a> turned on. The faction being
  stolen from will receive a message, telling it that it was stolen from, but
  not from who.</p>

  <p>If the thief's stealth skill level is as high as the best perception
  skill level of the target's faction in the region, the theft fails and the
  target faction receives a message telling it that it was the victim of a
  theft attempt, but the identity of the thief was unknown. If the thief's
  stealth skill level is lower than the best perception skill level of the
  target's faction, then the target's faction will know who the thief
  was.</p>

  <h2><a name="trade" id="trade">Establishing trade relations</a></h2>

  <p>In every region, the peasantry produce one special luxury item. Your
  units may purchase this product. In all regions that do not produce this
  special luxury product, there is a continuously rising demand. If you are
  not afraid of the risks involved in long distance travelling, trading is a
  very lucrative method of earning silver.</p>

  <p>In order to trade, a unit needs the trade skill. For every level of
  trade skill, a unit can buy up to 10 luxury items or sell 10 luxury items.
  The better the trader is and the more traders are present, the more items
  can be bought and sold each turn.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, some form of castle is needed for the trade to take place.
  At least a tradepost size castle is required. It does not matter who
  controls the castle, the owner cannot directly prevent the trading from
  taking place. However, he can indirectly prevent trading from going on by
  simply attacking the trading units with his own armed units.</p>

  <p>Units can only trade from a ship if the region is not being guarded or
  if all of the guarding factions have set HELP GUARD to the unit's
  faction.</p>

  <p>The owner of the biggest castle within a region receives part of the
  trade profits of the region, much like customs. This silver is deducted
  from the earnings of every trader. If there are two castles of the same size
  in a region, no one will receive the customs money. The amount deducted for
  customs can be found in <a href="production.html#CASTLES">this
  table</a>.</p>

  <p>This table shows the basic prices of luxury goods. The number of units
  of luxury goods that can be bought without raising the price is 1% of the
  number of peasants in the region. Every time this amount is bought (the
  total bought by all factions), the price rises by the basic price. A region
  with 2,000 peasants means 20 luxury items can be bought without raising the
  price. The price drops to normal the next turn because more luxury goods
  are produced.</p>

  <p>The sale price of a luxury item in a region is a multiple of the basic
  price, and is declared in the report of the region. As soon as 1% of the
  peasants has bought a certain good, the sale price drops by the basic price
  and rises again slowly in the following turns. Each turn, there is a 10%
  chance for each luxury good for its sale price to increase by its basic
  price. In regions with a harbour, this chance is 20%. For example, in a region
  with 1,000 peasants, as soon as 10 oil is sold there, the sale price of oil
  will drop by 3 silver (one basic price). Next turn, there is a 10% chance
  this sale price will rise again by 3 silver (one basic price).</p>

  <p>The sale prices of luxury items are independent of faction. Without
  trade agreements between players, the selling prices of luxury goods can
  easily be ruined.</p>

  <p>All purchases and sales of luxury goods are divided evenly amongst
  players. The dropping or raising of prices will affect all players who buy
  or sell that turn.</p>

  <p>In a region with 8,000 peasants, the sale price of incense is 4 silver,
  and the sale price of spices if 15 silver. 1% of the peasants in this
  region is 80. If all the traders in the region sell 200 spices, the first
  80 units are sold for 15 silver a piece, the next 80 units are sold for 10
  silver a piece (down one basic price for spices), and the last 40 spices
  are sold for only 5 silver a piece.</p>

  <p>If 100 incense is bought in the same region, the first 80 are bought at
  4 silver a piece, and the next 20 are bought at 8 silver a piece (an
  increase of one basic price).</p>

  <p>The region does not lose any money when luxury items are sold to the
  local peasantry. The peasants create luxury goods to be sold elsewhere,
  replacing the silver taken out of the region. The silver does not appear of
  thin air, rather it is abstracted away under the guise of peasant
  productivity.</p>

  <h2><a name="pools" id="pools">Silver and item pools</a></h2>

  <p>Especially with big factions you might lose track of the available
  amounts of silver and other items. Obviously, distributing silver among
  your units is a burden.</p>

  <p>The silver pool relieves the player from this task. When a unit is given
  the recruit order, it automatically takes enough silver (if the faction
  possesses enough silver on all its units in that region) to recruit the new
  persons. The same occurs when a unit tries to learn a skill that costs
  silver. Remember that using the silver pool may take away silver needed to
  feed other units.</p>

  <p>Buildings can likewise be supplied out of the silver pool if the silver
  is in the region at the beginning of the turn. If the faction which owns
  the building cannot pay the maintenance costs, the building is ineffective
  for this turn. At the end of the turn, the faction will try to pay the
  maintenance costs again. If there is still not enough materials or silver,
  the building collapses.</p>

  <p>Units will never give away silver which they need for their own food. If
  you want them to hold on to more or all of their money, you can order them
  to <a href="orders.html#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> the silver.</p>

  <p>TEMP units cannot reserve silver. They take the money they need to
  recruit out of the silver pool, but if they need any money or items when
  moving into another region, it must be explicitly given to them from other
  units with the <a href="orders.html#GIVE">GIVE</a> order.</p>

  <p>Beware: When TEMP units receive silver, they will use it to recruit men
  to reach their desired size. If you give a TEMP unit 100 silver, it may not
  have 100 silver after it is done recruiting up to full size.</p>

  <p>Silver that is transferred with the GIVE or @GIVE order is automatically
  reserved and will not be used in the silver pool.</p>

  <p>The silver pool and RESERVE orders will not stop units from sharing
  silver to feed each other. All silver in a region will be used to feed a
  faction's units, despite any RESERVE orders or the turning off of the
  OPTION SILVERPOOL order.</p>

  <p>The item pool is identical to the silver pool regarding materials. Every
  unit which needs something (stones, wood, etc.) for the construction of
  buildings will take it from any unit in the region. Units can also RESERVE
  materials so that no other unit will use them for another purpose. As with
  silver, all items transferred with the GIVE or @GIVE orders are
  automatically reserved.</p>

  <p>Beware: The item pool only works for production, i.e. the MAKE order. If
  a unit needs weapons for collecting taxes, those weapons must be
  transferred with the GIVE order first.</p>

  <p>Inexperienced factions should think carefully about using the item pool,
  it is easy to accidentally take resources from other units and upset
  orders.</p>
