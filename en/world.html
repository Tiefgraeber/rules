  <h1>The World of Eressea</h1>

  <h2>Geography of Eressea</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Restfully, Selen Ard'Ragorn watched the door when Rahel, her young
    novice, clumsily stumbled into the small chamber in the library panel of
    the temple. A little bit amused she regarded the nervously twitching tail
    of the young cat, who desperatly but unsuccessfully tried to even her
    creased robe.</p>

    <p>"Come closer, my child", Selen asked. Rahel bashfully neared the
    decorated table where the abbess sat. As the young cat caught sight of
    the big parchment spreaded on the table, she amazedly miaowed. She saw a
    detailed handdrawn map of the whole known world. Informations from all
    countries controlled by the Gold-Eyed Cat had been collected and sketched
    in this map by skilled hands. Rahel discerned Andune, the little island
    almost divided into two, amid of the sea. Around Andune she saw the
    well-known contours of the neighboring islands, embedded in the eternal
    ocean.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The world of Eressea consists of many islands and continents with
  entirely different sizes. Islands and oceans are segmented to regions. The
  units of the players, buildings and ships as well as peasants and several
  raw materials are found in the regions.</p>

  <p>Rahel still regarded the map, which was actually secret, when Selen
  pointed her finger on an island at the margin of the map. "Look at this,
  Rahel. There is an island that was just sketched in. Do you understand the
  way our mapmakers work?"</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The novice contemplated the map. Appearently it was confined to the
    essential, the discovered districts where only roughly classified. Rahel
    recognised forrests and mountains, many swamps and some plains.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In this example, a swamp is located at (0,0), in its northeast at (0,1)
  you can find a mountain. Every faction in Eressea has its own coordinate
  system, which can be shifted with the command <a href="orders.html#ORIGIN">
  ORIGIN</a>. This can be
  comfortable if you want to adjust your map to the one of another
  faction.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Good", Selen comfirmed the so much younger cat. "These maps are
    mostly used for navigating our ships. But you notice they contain only
    little informations. Because of that..." - Selen opened a big, heavy book
    beside the map, - "...our scouts send us detailled reports about the
    explored regions every week. We gather these reports, because they are
    important for our decisions."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>The Lands of Eressea</h2>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Selen pointed her finger on the open page. "Take a look at this and
    tell me, what you see." Rahel looked at the text and started.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The report is your survey of all regions your units passed through, you
  can see from a lighthouse and of course of those your units are staying
  in:</p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><tt>Tetos (-1,0), plain, 1042 peasants,
  73/5 trees, 10953 silver, 132 horses. To the northwest lies the the forest
  of Faldorn (-2,1), to the northeast the plain of Litforuvys (-1,1), to the
  east the plain of Tumyvesfod (0,0), to the southeast the swamp of Titymovut
  (0,-1), to the southwest the plain of Livedfir (-1,-1) an to the west the
  mountain of Nipevan (-2,0).</tt></font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"First, there is the region's name and of what kind it is. We can also
    see how many peasants live there and how much silver they've got.
    Finally, the scout has reported the amount of trees and horses he has
    found in this region."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>You can integrate peasants in your party by the command
  <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE</a>
  is used to cut trees and tame wild horses.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"Look, Rahel. There are some more informations."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><tt>The local market offers incense at a
  price of 4 silver. Traders can sell balm for 12 silver, spice for 10
  silver, gems for 21 silver, myrrh for 15 silver, oil for 12 silver and silk
  for 30 silver.<br />
  <br />
  Statistics for Tetos (-1,0):<br />
  <br />
  Entertainment: max. 547 silver<br />
  Worker's salary: 11 silver<br />
  Recruits: max. 26 peasants<br />
  Luxury goods at this price: 10<br />
  People: 20<br />
  silver: 821<br />
  wood: 13<br />
  swords: 2<br />
  horses: 4</tt></font></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>"This are further informations our scouts found out. First, they went
    to the market and notated the prices. Then there are facts about the
    peasants and their money: How much silver will they spend for musicians
    and showmen, how are the wages for simple jobs, how many peasants are
    willing to join a faction and what amount of luxuries can be buyed or
    sold on the market to the prices above. In the last lines is remarked,
    how many members of our faction are staying in that region and what items
    they have got."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>At Luxuries you can see the amount of goods buyed or sold by the
  peasants for the "list price" (see also Luxuries). Trading more goods will
  change the price durably! For further informations look at the chapter
  <a href="income.html#trade">TRADE</a>.</p>

  <p>"Excellent, my child. This is a complete report. Sometimes we only get
  less extensive ones, especially when our scout only passed through a region
  with his horse."</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Selen pointed at a chair. "You may sit down." Rahel took place,
    purring silent, a littlebit satisfied she had not disappointed her
    teacher, but also wondering what comes next. The ordinated of the
    Gold-Eyed Cat leaned back in her chair and watched her. "This are just
    numbers, usefull and worth to be preserved. But exploring the laws they
    are based on is very important, too."</p>

    <p>Standing up, Selen took out another parchment of the bag she placed
    beneath the table and spreaded it above the map. Rahel tried to
    understand the chaotic drawing of almost horizontal lines, but she
    couldn't make head or tail of it. "Explain it to me, please."</p>

    <p>"This, my child, is an attempt to find out about natural laws. Every
    week, the amount of peasants, trees and horses are changing in the
    regions. They die, are born or emigrate. I tried to find out why they do
    so, whithout having asked them." A silent smile appeared on Selens face.
    "It seems that most depends on the space, peasants, trees and horses must
    share." The young novice pointed at two little drawings scribbled at the
    edge of the parchment. "And what does this mean? It looks similar to the
    big one." "In the big picture, I sketched in the figures of a plain near
    the ocean with fertile soil. The little one describes the development of
    an inhospitable swamp. You see, it's similar, but the swamp's got less of
    all.</p>

  <h2>The Calendar of Eressea</h2>

  <p>Selen Ard'Ragorn rised of her chair. Rahel also stood up and admired how
  supple the old abtress moved. She already knew what would follow. At the
  end of every instruction, they were taking a walk through the spacious
  garden of the temple. Thereby, she also got some more lections.</p>

  <p>They walked through a little grove, when Selen said: "Do you notice the
  descending sun? So early... Soon, it will be winter. Anon, the "storm moon"
  will be expelled by "hearth fire". A deprivating time for most of us. Very
  hard for the insects, they can't breed in winter." "But, magistra, our
  sailors are relieved that the time of destructive storms has gone and the
  sea turns safe again." "You're right, Rahel. So, you can find everywhere
  something positive."</p>

  <p>Even when it was night, the guardians of the temple saw the two cats
  strolling through the garden, lightened by magic...</p>

  <p>Eresseas year is divided into nine months with each three weeks:</p>

    </table>
  </center>

  <p>Every turn of the game corresponds one week in Eresseas world. Many
  things can be done in one week. But there are some actions lasting almost
  the whole week, you can only do one of them in one turn (See also the
  chapter <a href="advice.html#longshortorders">Length of commands</a>).</p>
