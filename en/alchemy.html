  <h1>Alchemy and Herbalism</h1>

  <p>Alchemy potions are made from herbs and can be used by any unit. Potions
  are made using the alchemy skill, and herbs are gathered with the herbalism
  skill. Learning alchemy costs 200 silver, and only three people per faction
  may learn this skill. Herbalism also costs 200 silver, but there is no
  limit to the number of people who can know this skill.</p>

  <p>Gathering herbs is essentially a kind of production, the correct order
  to do so is <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE HERBS</a>. The number of herbs
  found depends on skill level. In addition, only one type of herb grows in
  any one particular region. If one is not careful in harvesting, all the
  herbs in a region can be harvested, leaving none to grow back. In this
  case, the regional herb must be planted again using the <a href=
  "orders.html#GROW">GROW HERBS</a> command.</p>

  <p>Be careful, fresh herbs don't last forever. Herbs will rot with
  time.</p>

  <p>When an herbalist has reached level 7 in the herbalism skill, he or she
  may make an estimate of how many herbs are left in the region.</p>

  <p>Herbalism has no guarantees. Finding herbs is a long and difficult
  process. Even with high levels in herbalism it is possible to find only
  small amounts, or no herbs at all.</p>

  <h2><a name="potions" id="potions">Potions</a></h2>

  <p>Potions are made from herbs by giving the order <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE">MAKE &lt;name of potion&gt;</a>. At least two different
  herbs are needed per type of potion. Every second level of skill in alchemy
  an alchemist reaches, he or she will learn a new recipe for a potion.
  The potion's level will be up to half of the new level in alchemy.</p>

  <p>Each of your alchemists may brew <b>level_of_alchemy/level_of_potion</b>
  potions of one type per turn.</p>

  <p>The herbs growing in the world of Eressea are listed in this <a href=
  "appendix_alchemy.html">table</a>, a list of all (as yet) existing potions
  is found in this <a href="appendix_alchemy.html#herbs">table</a>. To help
  minimize confusion between people speaking different languages, a third
  <a href="appendix_alchemy.html#translation">table</a> lists the german
  and english names of all herbs and potions.</p>

  <p>Using a potion requires the order <a href=
  "orders.html#USE"><tt>USE</tt></a>. Most potions give their benefits to the
  unit giving the order. Exceptions are potions which affect a region, then
  the region where the unit was at the beginning of turn is affected. Another
  case is the "duncebuns" potion: you can apply it to a certain unit
  with the order <a href="orders.html#USE"><tt>USE "duncebuns"
  &lt;unit-id&gt;</tt></a>. The application of the potion fails if the
  STEALTH skill of the acting unit is less or equal to the victim's
  PERCEPTION+2. In this case, you get an error message and the
  duncebuns is not used up (thus it remains where it is).</p>

  <p>Normally a potion affects 10 people or 10 goods during the turn it is
  used, as mentioned in its recipe. Its effects end at the end of the turn it
  is used. Each turn, a unit may only use one type of potion. No two
  different potions may affect any one unit. However, there are exceptions,
  such as potions which are used automatically (like the healing potion after
  a battle). Multiple potions work on more than 10 people in a unit, but in
  any case the effect only lasts until next week. So a given unit of 50
  people may use five potions of one type for all to gain its effect.
  However, the effects will not last until next week, nor can the effects be
  spread out over multiple weeks or over only certain units. A potion used on
  a unit of 10 people will still affect all 10 people, even if that unit is
  broken up into many smaller units.</p>

  <p>If a given unit consists of 12 people, normally this will not matter.
  The potion will work on only ten of them. The "Beserker's Blood" potion is
  an exception because during a battle the people of a unit are treated
  individually. If you want to use this potion make sure that <b>all</b>
  people of the unit are affected, or it will not work!</p>
