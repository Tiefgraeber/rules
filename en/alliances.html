  <h1>Alliances</h1>

  <p>Alliances are the basis of cooperation in the world of Eressea. If you
  are looking to trade, declare war, or make peace, alliances are the
  cornerstone of player interaction. All alliances are formed using the
  <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP</tt></a> order.</p>

  <p>If you use the <tt>HELP</tt> order to support another faction, it is by
  no means required to act likewise. It is up to the other faction to decide
  on how to reciprocate the alliance. The wise usually put alliances to the
  test before relying upon them.</p>

  <p>In addition, there are several different types of the <tt>HELP</tt>
  order. To ensure that <tt>HELP</tt> is not abused, it is possible to limit
  what kind of "assistance" your allies can give you. Examples of sabotage
  include: a unit that is supposed to travel extensively could be weighed
  down with a bunch of stones, or an opponent's elite units could be reduced
  to regular units by adding unskilled men into their ranks.</p>

  <h2><a name="help" id="help">The different types of support</a></h2>

  <dl>
    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; GIVE</dt>

    <dd>Your own units will accept everything given to them by units of the
    indicated faction (silver, items etc.) This order is like a permanent
    <a href="orders.html#CONTACT">CONTACT</a> order.</dd>

    <dd>In order to give men or units to units of a different faction, the
    receiving unit still has to use the order <a href=
    "orders.html#CONTACT">CONTACT &lt;unit no.&gt;</a></dd>

    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; COMBAT</dt>

    <dd>Your own units (both FRONT or REAR position) will take part in any
    fight in which the indicated allied faction is attacked. If you are
    allied with both sides of the warring factions your units will not take
    part in the fight.</dd>

    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; SILVER</dt>

    <dd>You will support the indicated faction with silver coins if
    necessary. Should any of the other faction's units need silver for
    nourishment the silver will be taken from your faction. Your units will
    never give away silver that they need to support themselves.</dd>

    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; GUARD</dt>

    <dd>Normally, if a region is guarded, no other faction will be able to
    tax, recruit or produce raw materials. Sometimes units moving through 
    the guarded territory may be stopped.</dd>

    <dd>If you order your faction to <tt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; GUARD</tt>,
    the indicated faction will be allowed to move, tax or produce raw materials
    in regions guarded by your faction.</dd>

    <dd>This order will also allow the indicated faction to enter your ships
    and castles.</dd>

    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; FACTIONSTEALTH</dt>

    <dd>If you disguise your units via the <a href=
    "orders.html#HIDE"><tt>HIDE FACTION NUMBER faction-id</tt></a> order as
    belonging to a different faction, all factions provided with this help
    status can discover the true identity of such units.</dd>

    <dt>HELP &lt;faction no.&gt; ALL</dt>

    <dd>This order will help the indicated faction in all of the above
    areas.</dd>
