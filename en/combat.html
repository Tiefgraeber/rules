  <h1>The Art of War</h1>You cannot avoid conflicts in Eressea. There are
  conflicts because of silver, regions, taxes, trading routes and so on.
  Therefore you must search for friends and allies because: "Friends come and
  go, but enemies always increase."

  <h2><a name="siege" id="siege"></a>Sieging</h2>If you have enough armed
  men, you can besiege a castle. How many men you need depends on the size of
  the castle: for every size-point of the castle you need two men. Therefore
  you need 128 men to siege a size 64 castle. These men must be armed or have
  a catapult, and must be able to use their weapons (i.e. have the
  appropriate weapon skills).

  <p>You must guard the region with the castle one week before you can start
  sieging the castle. After this, in the next turn, you can start the siege.
  Therefore you must be careful about guarding units of foreign factions. If
  a castle is besieged, its inhabitants are cut of from the outer world and
  all sources of income. If the besiegers have catapults, they fire these and
  slowly destroy the castle.</p>

  <p>If a unit's stealth skill exceeds the perception skill of the besieging
  unit by at least three levels, it can leave and enter the castle at will
  e.g. to smuggle goods into the castle.</p>

  <p>You can besiege a castle as long as you want. If the besieged faction
  can't end the siege through negotiation then only an attack against the
  besieging faction can end the siege.</p>

  <h2><a name="sides" id="sides"></a>Taking sides: resolving
  allegiances</h2>Use the <a href="orders.html#ATTACK">ATTACK</a> order to
  order one of your units to attack another player's units. The timing of
  ATTACK orders is randomly executed. During an attack, all units in the
  region gather and fight man to man. A battle lasts at most 5 rounds, plus a
  special round called the <a href="combat.html#battle">tactician's round</a>.

  <p>The attackers are all units who had the order ATTACK against one or more
  units of the defenders.</p>

  <p>The defenders are units which were attacked directly, combat ready units
  of the attacked faction (units in COMBAT, COMBAT AGGRESSIVE, COMBAT REAR or
  COMBAT DEFENSIV stance), and combat ready units of any factions allied
  with the attacked faction (i.e. allied using <a href="orders.html#HELP">HELP
  COMBAT</a>).</p>

  <p>There are different reasons why a unit joins the battle. These are in
  following priority:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The combat-ready unit attacks another unit. This unit will always enter
    combat.</li>

    <li>The unit is attacked by another unit. In this case the unit takes its
    position in the battle formation according to its COMBAT stance.</li>

    <li>An unit of the own faction is attacked by somebody. The unit enters
    combat if neither COMBAT NOT or COMBAT FLEE is set. In the latter case
    the unit does not try to flee, because it was not directly threatened.
    Instead, it will stay in the region and not participate in the
    fighting.</li>

    <li>A unit of an allied faction (a faction in which HELP COMBAT was set)
    is attacked by somebody. The unit enters combat if neither COMBAT NOT or
    COMBAT FLEE is set. In the latter case it does not flee, because it is
    not directly threatened. Instead, it will stay in the region and not
    participate in the fighting.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Allies help the defenders automatically only if the defender himself
  does not attack. Attacked units defend themselves with the whole faction except
  units which explicitly have orders keeping them from fighting. For an
  attack the COMBAT stance matters. Units with COMBAT NOT or
  COMBAT FLEE settings cannot attack.</p>

  <p><b>Warning!</b> Units in a besieged castle cannot help units outside the
  castle.</p>

  <p>If more factions want to attack a single faction they should ally by
  setting HELP COMBAT to each other, because it is possible that the attacked
  faction will counter-attack one of the two factions. In this case, the two
  factions will help each other only when this status is set.</p>

  <p>To attack a common enemy together every faction has to attack at least
  one unit of the enemy. To defend against a common enemy it is enough to
  have set HELP COMBAT amongst each other.</p>

  <p>Normally, two factions are considered allied when they both have COMBAT
  HELP set towards each other, and neither attacks a faction that the other
  is also allied with.</p>

  <p>Example 1:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>A</b> helps <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. <b>C</b> attacks <b>B</b>, <b>A</b>
    joins the fight because <b>B</b> is allied. <b>C</b> is not allied because
    it attacked an allied faction.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Who fight against whom?</p>

  <p>A faction fights against its enemies. Its enemies are factions which
  attack it, factions which it attacks, or factions that attack its allies. A
  faction "helps" everyone who is fighting against one of its enemies. In
  this case, the COMBAT stance doesn't matter.</p>

  <p>Example 2:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>A</b> helps <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> attack each
    other. <b>A</b> helps neither <b>B</b> nor <b>C</b>, because nobody counts
    as ally and nobody is enemy of <b>A</b>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Example 3:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>A</b> attacks <b>B</b> and <b>C</b>. <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> help each
    other even if they are not allied, because <b>A</b> is a mutual enemy. If
    <b>B</b> has only archers and <b>C</b> only front fighters the fighters of
    <b>C</b> save the archers of <b>B</b>. Exception: <b>B</b> and <b>C</b> are
    enemies, because for example <b>B</b> fights against <b>D</b>, an ally of
    <b>C</b>. In this case they do not help each other and also not against
    <b>A</b>.
  </blockquote>

  <p>Example 4:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> attack <b>C</b>. <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> help each
    other even if they are not allied, because <b>C</b> is a mutual enemy.
  </blockquote>

  <a name="battle" id="battle"></a>
  <h2>The battle</h2>

  <p>A battle lasts at most 5 rounds plus a possible tactician's ambush. In
  every round the combatants attack in random order.</p>

  <p>Generally, units that participate in combat (these are units showing up
  in the list of combatants) cannot execute long orders. Exceptions are
  <a href="combat.html#ships">battles on the ocean</a> and battles in regions which
  are guarded by at least one units that has a HELP GUARD status or
  belongs to the combatant's own faction. In this case the unit can carry out
  further long orders.</p>

  <a name="formations" id="formations"></a>
  <h2>Formations</h2>

  <p>In the battle there are four rows, composed of the units that are actually
  in the battle. For more information consult <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">
  COMBAT</a>.</p>

  <p>1st row: units that have set <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT</a> or 
  <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT AGGRESSIVE</a>.<br />
  2nd row: units that have set <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT REAR</a> or 
  <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT DEFENSIVE</a><br />
  3rd row: units that have set <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT NOT</a><br />
  4th row: persons that try to flee. These are fighters who have a
  <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT FLEE</a> stance and such person who have
  taken too much damage (see also <a href="combat.html#escape">escaping</a>).</p>

  <p>Only the first two rows are able to attack (with melee or missile
  weapons). Units in the third row will stay out of combat until the rows in
  front of it are overrun, and fleeing units stay all the way to the back,
  trying to <a href="combat.html#escape">escape</a>.</p>

  <p>Units which fight in the second row can only be attacked in close combat
  if they join the front. They defend against ranged attacks from range fighters
  with their best combat skill.</p>

  <p>Magicians can cast spells in first and second row. If no combat spell is
  set the magicians arm themselves and fight with their weapons. They defend
  themselves with their equipped weapon.</p>

  <p><b>Overrunning</b><br /> If a faction and its allies have more than three
  times more enemies at the front row, all units from second row move to front,
  making themselves vulnerable to close combat. If the second row is empty, the
  third and fourth row get drawn into combat. This is checked before every combat
  turn.</p>

  <a name="muster" id="muster"></a>
  <h2>Mustering of soldiers</h2>

  <p>Now the units arm themselves. Every person in every unit picks one melee
  and one missile weapon as well as a piece of armor they are able to use. Weapons are
  preferred in order of the sum of the attack and defense skill of the unit with
  this weapon. Magicians with a combat spell set use their spell. For defending
  they need a weapon (and the skill) otherwise they are unarmed.</p>

  <p><b>Attention</b>: unused weapons and armor are not given to units which are
  not armed.</p>

  <p>During combat, weapons are not exchanged unless a person in the unit with
  a better set of weapon dies. The surviving fighters always use the best
  available sets of weapons.</p>

  <p>Archers who find themselves moved to the front rows must use a melee
  weapon (and have an appropriate skill of at least one), or they will
  defend themselves like unarmed units.</p>

  <h2>The tactician's ambush</h2>

  <p>At the beginning of the battle the faction with the best tactician
  gets an extra round to attack. A tactician, who fights in the front
  row, gets a +1 bonus to his tactics-skill. If he stands in the 3rd or 4th
  row his tactics skill will be reduced by 1. If both sides have equally
  skilled tacticians, both sides can attack.</p>

  <p>Every tactician gets a bonus which starts at 0 and can get very high,
  although the probability of getting an extreme high bonus is relatively
  low.</p>

  <a name="heroes" id="heroes"></a>
  <h2>Heroes</h2>

  <p>Heroes are great fighters. To make a unit to heroes, use the 
  <a href="orders.html#PROMOTION">PROMOTION</a> command.</p>

  <p>Unlike normal fighters heroes get 10 attacks per combat round.</p>

  <p><b>Attention:</b>That does not work for magical attacks, crossbows and
  catapults.</p>

  <p>For more details check <a href="orders.html#PROMOTION">here</a>.</p>

  <a name="melee" id="melee"></a>
  <h2>Melee Combat</h2>

  Individual fighters face each other according to these rules:

  <ul>
    <li>If both fighters are on the same skill-level the attacker has the base
    to-hit probability (BP) of 30%.</li>

    <li>Add/substract bonuses: Some weapons have attack or defense
    <a href="combat.html#tables">modifiers</a>. Missile weapons may have an extra
    <a href="combat.html#table1">penalty</a> to hit, reflecting the difficulty of using
    these weapons. There are also some other influences, check <a href="combat.html#modifiers">
    here</a>.</li>

    <li>If it's a ranged attack the modified skill level of the defender is halved.</li>

    <li>The difference of the two skill levels is added to the BP, shifting the
    to-hit probability by 5% per skill-level difference. <br />
    BP = ((weaponskill(attacker) + modifiers(attacker)) - (weaponskill(defender) +
    modifiers(defender)))*5% + 30%.</li>

    <li>To determine whether the attacker hit, a random number between 0 and 99 is
    calculated and added to his BP. If the result is greater than 100%, a hit is
    dealt. If the result is greater than 90% (critical hit), yet another random
    number between 0 and 99 is added. Thus there is a chance to hit a far better
    (may be because of skill, may be because of modifiers) opponent.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Every person attacks once per combat round (except heroes).</p>

  <p>A hit causes damage depending on the weapon used. Different weapons cause
  different amounts of damage. It's always helpful to have a high weapon
  skill level, per two points skill-level-difference between attacker and defender
  one point is added to the damage. Only the weapon skill levels of the weapons
  actually used are considered and modifiers e.g. based on horse-back combat do
  not affect the damage dealt. This applies to both ranged and close combat. For
  weapon statistics check <a href="combat.html#tables">here</a>.</p>

  <p>If a fighter receives more damage than his current hit points, he dies.
  The damage taken in a battle is cumulative.</p>

  <p>If a fighter wears armor, the protection value of the armor is
  substracted from the damage of every hit. It is possible to use up to one
  piece of armor and one shield together. However, armor (but not shields) usually
  slightly increase the chances that a fighter will be successfully hit in
  combat. Shields provide less protection, but also slightly reduce the
  chance a fighter will be successfully struck in combat (check
  <a href="combat.html#table4"> here</a>). The effect of armor against crossbows is
  halved (rounded down).</p>

  <p>Lastly, the skill <a href="combat.html#endurance"><tt>ENDURANCE</tt></a> gives
  units extra hit points.</p>

  <a name="missile" id="missile"></a>
  <h2>Ranged combat</h2>

  <p>Missile weapons and catapults are best used from the second row. There they
  are screened by the close combat fighters.</p>

  <p>On average 67% of people using missile weapons target fighters in the
  front row, while the other 33% pick a random target from the first two rows.</p>

  <p>Crossbows are armor-piercing: The effect of armor against crossbows is
  halved (rounded down).</p>

  <p><a href="combat.html#table1">This table</a> shows the differences between the
  missile weapons. It is very hard to use a bow, but you can use it every
  round. Crossbows are much easier to handle but you can use them only every
  third round. Every catapult fires randomly in one of the 5 first combat rounds,
  doing heavy damage.</p>

  <p>To dodge any missile attack, units defend themselves with only half
  their skill. Units in the first row defend themselves with their full
  skill, if the ranged fighter stands in the first row.</p>

  <p><b>Attention:</b> If a fighter has to defend against a close-combat attack,
  he has to use a close-combat weapon. If he doesn't have one or lacks the
  required skill for the weapon he fights <a href="combat.html#modifiers">unarmed</a>.</p>

  <p>Catapults require ammunition. Ammunition is made by units having the
  quarrying skill. Skill level 3 is required to create one salvo worth of
  ammunition, enough to fire 6 shots.</p>

  <p>All attacks with a missile weapon are penalized by the value in the
  penalty column of the table.</p>

  <p>The reload time indicates how many rounds it takes to reload the weapon.
  Therefore a catapult can be used once in combat. Crossbows fire every third
  round and bows every round.</p>

  <a name="modifiers" id="modifiers"></a>
  <h2>Bonuses and penalties</h2>

  Various factors affect the chances of succesfully hitting an opponent:

  <ol>
    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">unarmed or wrong weapon skill:</span>
    Unarmed units fight with a skill level of -2 while Orcs with a skill level
    equal to their highest weapon skill -3. Fighters with weapons but no
    appropriate skills also fight with skill level -2.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">castle bonus:</span> Units in castles
    get a bonus to defense. This bonus depends on the size of the castle. The
    different buildings give a bonus from +1 to +5. If units attack from inside
    the castle they don't get this bonus. The bonus also applies if attacked with missile
    weapons.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">horse bonus:</span> In plains, deserts,
    and highlands units in the first row can use horses. To ride a horse in battle
    you need at least a RIDING skill level of 2. Mounted units get a +2 bonus for
    attack and defense because they are faster and more agile. A unit that is
    attacked and profits from a castle bonus does not get the horse bonus.
    Trolls cannot use horses in combat.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">lance/spear bonus:</span> mounted lance and
    spear wielders get another +1 bonus to attack. This is in addition to the standard
    +1 OB bonus lances (but not spears) give when attacking.</li>

    <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">halberd bonus:</span> spear and halberd fighters
    without horse get a +1 bonus to defense against mounted units. This is in addition to
    the standard +2 DB bonus halberds always give when defending.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Examples:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Base to-hit probability: 30%<br />
    Attacker with skill level 3, defender skill level 4 -&gt; BP=25%<br />
    Defender is inside a citadel -&gt; +5 -&gt; BP=0%<br />
    The attacker has only a chance of 10% to score a critical hit (above
    90%) and therefore receive another roll of the dice. The attacker then
    has a 90% chance of rolling the remaining needed 10%. This means that
    the attacker has an overall 9% chance of successfully striking a
    defender in a Citadel (10% x 90% = 9%). Obviously, Citadels provide
    excellent defense assuming one does not leave them to attack.</li>

    <li>Base to-hit probability: 30%<br />
    This time the defender is outside the citadel:<br />
    Attacker with skill level 3, defender skill level 4 -&gt; BP=25%<br />
    If the attacker has RIDING of at least 2 and uses a horse, he receives a
    horse bonus of +2 to his attack skill level -&gt; BP=35%</li>

    <li>A swordsman with MELEE 3 attacks a horseman with RIDING 1 and POLEARM 2.
    -&gt; BP=35%<br />
    The swordsman receives his weapon skill level (MELEE 3) as a bonus to
    hit, but receives the horseman's weapon skill level (POLEARM 2) as a
    penalty to hit. The horseman does not receive a +2 horse bonus to defense
    because his RIDING skill is too low.</li>

    <li>An archer with BOW 9 attacks from the 2nd row against a horseman using a lance
    with RIDING 3 and POLEARM 9. The Archer receives a total attack bonus of +7
    (+9 for BOW 9, and -2 for using a bow). The horseman defends at +5 (his
    defender skill is halved: weapon skill 9; +2 for being mounted -&gt;
    (9+2)/2=5). BP=(7-5)*5%+30%=40%</li>

    <li>A horseman using a lance with RIDING 3 and POLEARM 9 attacks an archer
    with BOW 9.</li>
    <ul>
       <li>The horseman receives a total attack bonus of +12 (+9 for his
       POLEARM 9, +2 for using a horse with RIDING of at least 2, and +1 for
       using a spear or lance while mounted). The archer defends at -2 because
       the archer does not have a close combat weapon. BP=100%<br />
       The horseman will hit the archer with every attack.</li>

       <li>The horseman defends at +11 (9 for his polearm-skill, +2 for being
       mounted), because the archer stands in the first row. The Archer receives
       a total attack bonus of +7 (+9 for BOW 9, and -2 for using a bow).
       The archer attacks with +7 a horseman with +11. BP=(7-11)*5%+30%=10%</li>
    </ul>

    <li>A spearman with POLEARM 3 inside a castle attacks a horseman with RIDING
    2 and POLEARM 3. The spearman's total attack bonus is +3 (+3 for POLEARM
    3, he does not receive the halberd bonus or the castle bonus because he
    attackes). The horseman's total defense bonus is +5 (+3 for POLEARM 3, +2
    horse bonus, no lance bonus because he is defending). BP=(3-5)*5%+30%=20%</li>

    <li>A horseman with RIDING 2 and MELEE 2 attacks a spearman holding a halberd
    with POLEARM 3. The horseman attacks with a +4 attack bonus (+2 skill level, +2
    horse bonus) against the spearman's +6 defense bonus (+3 skill level, +2
    halberd DB, and a further +1 halberd bonus against mounted units). BP=20%</li>

    <li>A spearman holding a halberd with POLEARM 3 attacks a horseman with RIDING 2
    and MELEE 2. The spearman attacks with a +2 bonus (+3 from POLEARM 3, -1 for using
    a halberd to attack. There is no halberd bonus against a mounted unit
    because the spearman attacked). The horseman defends with a +4 defense
    bonus (+2 for MELEE 2, and +2 for riding a horse with at least RIDING 2). BP=20%</li>

    <li>A horseman with RIDING 2, POLEARM 3 and a lance attacks another horseman
    with same skill levels. The attacking horseman attacks with a +6 attack bonus
    (+3 for POLEARM 3, +2 for riding a horse with at least RIDING 2, and +1 for
    attacking with a lance/spear while mounted). The defending horseman has a
    defense bonuse of +5 (+3 for POLEARM 3, and +2 for riding a horse with at
    least RIDING 2). BP=35%</li>

  </ul>

  <a name="escape" id="escape"></a>
  <h2>Escaping</h2>

  <p>Men trying to escape will attempt to do so every round, and may take damage
  before they successfully escape.</p>

  Men with <a href="orders.html#ATTACK">ATTACK</a>ed.<br />
  Men with <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT DEFENSIVE</a> will try to flee if they fall below 90% of their total hit points.<br />
  Men with <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT REAR</a> will try to flee if they fall below 20% of their total hit points.<br />
  Men with <a href="orders.html#COMBAT">COMBAT AGGRESSIVE</a> will never flee.

  <p>The basic chance to flee is 25% (50% for halflings) plus 10% if one has
  a horse and 5% for each level in stealth, but its capped at 75% (90% for
  halflings).</p>

  <p>Units that flee retreat from battle and watch its outcome from a safe distance.
  If during a fight at least one person is fleeing from a unit, then the entire unit
  leaves the building they were standing in.</p>

  <p>All units with STATUS FLEE are allowed to move after the battle, even if they aren't
  allowed to execute long orders. Units with STATUS FLEE cannot guard the region. If a
  unit with this status is currently guarding a region, it will stop doing so from this
  week on.</p>

  <a name="ships" id="ships"></a>
  <h2>Ships</h2>

  <p>Battle upon ships is much the same as battle upon land. The ships board
  each other and the enemy units fight against each other. Combat on the ocean
  allows everyone involved to execute long orders.</p>

  <p>Ships get 5% damage for every round after round 1 (up to 20%) if somebody
  on the ship gets hit during the battle. Ships without or with too few men drift
  out of control.</p>

  <p>If you want to disembark units from a ship in a guarded region, they must
  first leave the ship before they can attack in the next turn. This gives the
  enemy a chance to react.</p>

  <p>You can attack from land without delay. The fight between ships is only
  possible on the ocean.</p>

  <a name="piracy" id="piracy"></a>
  <h2>Piracy</h2>

  <p>Piracy gives a captain the possibility to capture enemy ships in
  neighboring regions.</p>

  <p>The captain is lying in wait for ships which move into the neighboring
  regions. He steers the ship into the region when a ship belonging to a
  targeted faction arrives nearby. Factions can be targeted by using the
  <a href="orders.html#PIRACY">PIRACY &lt;faction num.&gt;</a> command. You
  can follow a ship with the order <a href="orders.html#FOLLOW">FOLLOW SHIP</a>.</p>

  You should pay attention to a few facts:

  <ul>
    <li>This also works if the ship is on the coast. So it is an effective
    possibility for securing a coastline.</li>

    <li>Pirate captains are really stupid. They can't judge if their target
    is more powerful than themselves. They will willingly move their ship and
    attack a fleet of 100 ships. Piracy has its risks.</li>

    <li>If there are more than one target, the captain picks one
    randomly.</li>

    <li>If a pirate of an allied faction who is in the same region, has found
    a target, your captain will attack the same ship if this is also an
    allowed target.</li>
  </ul>

  <a name="end" id="end"></a>
  <h2>The aftermath of battle</h2>

  <p>After this the fallen men are counted and all useful items from the dead
  are handed out to the survivors. All materials have only a 50% chance of
  surviving a battle. </p>

  <p>After the fight magicians can save units which have died.</p>

  <p>Units which were damaged in battle stay damaged. This is shown in
  reports.</p>

  <p>Wounds heal over time. Wounded units get 5% of their maximum hit points
  every turn, but at least 1 hit point per turn. Undead units cannot
  regenerate hit points.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>d stands for dice. The number after d is the amount of sides the dice have,
    the number before d the amount of dice rolled.<br /> For example: 2d10+5 equals
    rolling 2 10-sided dice, then adding 5 to the sum. 2d10+5 will give results
    between 7 (2 times 1, plus 5) and 25 (2 times 10, plus 5).</li>

    <li>Damage (from on foot) and Damage (from on horse) indicate how much
    damage that particular weapon does, either from on foot, or mounted. It
    does not matter whether the target is mounted or on foot, the damage
    inflicted solely depends upon whether the wielder is on foot or on a
    horse. Note that the difference in weapon skill level will add or
    subtract from the damage dealt.</li>

    <li>OB and DB are the offensive and defensive bonus. The OB is applied
    whenever a unit attacks (either initiated the attack, or it is counter-
    attacking). The DB is applied whenever a unit tries to parry. Axes are
    better at attacking, while halberds are better at defending.</li>

  <ul>
    <li>A man can use only one suit of armor, therefore multiple suits of
    armor do not provide additional protection. Units can use shields
    together with armor. Again, a man can only use one shield at a time.</li>

    <li>Platemail subtracts 5 points of damage per hit, but increases the
    chance to be hit by 30%. A shield subtracts 1 point of damage and reduces
    the chance to be hit by 15%. Natural armor only half counts if you wear
    armor. So a race with 2 natural armor can get an armor value of 9 (6
    from Laenmail, 2 from a Laenshield, and 1 from half their natural armor)
    or 7 (5 from Platemail, 1 from a Shield, and 1 from half their natural
    armor).</li>
  </ul>

  <blockquote>
    A soldier attacks an unarmed man and has a 60% chance to hit him. If the
    defender wears chainmail the chance is increased to 69% (60% x 115% =
    69%). However, the defender would take 3 less damage per hit. If the
    defender has a shield instead, the chance of him being hit is reduced to
    51% (60% x 85% = 51%). The defender would then take only 1 less damage
    per hit. With a Laenshield, the chance to be hit is reduced to 45% (60% x
    75% = 45%), and the defender would take 2 less damage per hit. Armor and
    shields are cumulative. With chainmail and a shield, the chance of being
    hit is 58.65% (60% x 115% x 85% = 58.65%). The defense value is always
    rounded down.

  <p>Magic resistance indicates what percentage of magic damage is

  added to the total.</p>

  <p>Natural armor reduces the damage from successful hits. Only half of
  natural armor is added if armor is worn.</p>
