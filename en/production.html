  <h1><a name="production" id="production">Producing items</a></h1>

  <p>There is a large number of items one can produce in Eressea. On the one
  hand, there are raw materials, such as iron, stones, logs of wood, or
  horses. On the other hand, there are the end products, such as various
  kinds of weapons, armor, ships, wagons, buildings, roads, or potions. In
  order to produce any of this, the appropriate skill is needed. Once a unit
  has this skill, it can be given the <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE</tt></a> order to produce something.</p>

  <p>Depending on the desired item, a certain minimum level of skill is
  reqruied. Some items require high levels of skill, and therefore only a few
  can be produced. In any case, every will only be able to produce one type
  of item or product or work on one building or ship per turn. The following
  examples illustrate this point:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A unit with 4 men and weaponsmithing 5 has altogether 20 production
    points. Provided the unit has the necessary raw materials, it can e.g.
    make 6 swords as the required minimum skill level for weaponsmithing is 3
    thus you have to divide 20 by 3. Alternatively, the unit could produce 4
    elven bows if they are elves, since the minimum skill level in
    weaponsmithing is 5 or just as well 10 spears (minimum weaponsmithing
    skill: 2).</p>

    <p>If this unit was inside a smithy that would halve its consumption of
    iron for shields, swords, and the like. The unit would be able to create
    10 shields from only 5 iron.</p>

    <p>Important: Production points are summed up on a per-unit basis. The
    minimum skill level is required per man in the unit. A unit with 2 men
    and a weaponsmithing skill level of 1 is not able to make a spear since
    the minimum skill level is 2.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>All raw materials can be obtained as soon as the necessary skill is
  acquired. The same applies to horses and herbs. This does not apply to
  Laen, an extremely rare and magical metal, and Mallorn, a rare magical
  wood. In order to produce Laen, a mining skill level of 7 is needed, in
  addition to a mine in the region. In order to produce Mallorn, a minimum
  forestry skill level of 2 is required.</p>

  <p>Certain raw materials such as iron, are limited. If the units in a
  region wish to produce more than is available, the raw materials present
  will be divided up among the units according to their numbers and skill
  levels.</p>

  <p>In general, the skill levels of all members of a unit are counted
  together and divided by the required minimum level of a skill. For each
  production point calculated this way a building or a ship can be extended
  by one size point or one item can be produced (provided the necessary raw
  materials are available). As an in the previous example, 4 men with 5
  weaponsmithing each have a total of 20 production points. They can create
  items that require up to a minimum of weaponsmithing level 5. These men
  therefore can make up to 6 swords in one turn. (weaponsmithing 3 times 6
  swords requires 18 points of weaponsmithing all together).</p>

  <p>Once the construction of a building or a ship has started, one can
  continue building with as many units and men as one wants. It is not
  possible to build several ships or buildings with only one unit, even if it
  has enough production points and raw materials to do so. One cannot change
  the kind of building or ship once construction has begun (i.e. a sawmill
  will stay a sawmill and never turn into a castle).</p>

  <p>For larger factions, the gathering of all the needed materials can be
  quite a nuisance. Raw materials are found in various different places
  depending on the type of raw material in question.</p>

  <h2><a name="resources" id="resources">Raw materials</a></h2>

  <p>Units guarding the region will prevent producing raw materials if the
  guarding faction has neither set <a href="orders.html#HELP">HELP ALL</a>
  nor <a href="orders.html#HELP">HELP GUARD</a> to your faction
  (see also <a href="orders.html#GUARD">GUARD</a> and
  <a href="orders.html#HELP">HELP</a>). This does not apply if the guards
  are not able to see the producer.</p>

  <p>Iron, stones and laen can be mined and quarried in glaciers, mountains
  and sometimes in certain regions. A mine and at least a skill level of 7 in
  the mining skill is required to mine Laen.</p>

  <p>After some time of producing raw materials, it gets harder and harder to
  get more, your report will for example show '20 iron/4', meaning that with a
  mining skill of 4, you can produce another 20 iron before you will need skill
  level 5 to continue.</p>

  <p>The development of Eressea's vegetation is determined by the seasons. In
  spring, seeds in the ground become young trees, and last year's young trees
  grow up to become trees. In the months of summer and autumn the trees drop
  their seeds which a herbalist with a herbalism skill of 3 resp. 4 or more
  can pick up by using the order <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE SEED</a> or
  <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE "MALLORN SEED"</a> and can plant these in
  another region by using the <a href="orders.html#PLANT">PLANT SEED / "MALLORN
  SEED"</a>.</p>

  <p>If a tree or mallorn tree is cut down to make wood, the forest will
  shrink and it will take time to grow back. Therefore, one has to be careful
  in the harvesting of trees, lest an entire forest is cut down and
  permanently destroyed.</p>

  <p>As long as there are enough trees, one can cut down as many as one
  needs. The mount of trees found in a region will be shown in your weekly
  report. The same applies to the number of Mallorntrees, which provide
  Mallorn wood. Like Laen, Mallorntrees can only be found in certain regions.
  Mallorntrees multiply like normal trees, but they will not spread out to
  other regions. They will remain only in their region of origin.</p>

  <p>You can catch and tame as many horses as you like, as long as there is
  at least one in the region. Only wild horses will breed on their own, but
  additional horses can be made with the help of horses inside a stable.</p>

  <p>End products can be created as desired. The only restrictions are the
  raw materials in stock, and the total amount of production points of the
  producing unit.</p>

  <p>The following table shows all the items which can be found in Eressea.
  They all can be obtained in some manner (i.e. taxation for silver, or
  trading to buy luxury goods). Most can be made if your unit has the
  appropriate skill level and (if needed) the right raw
  materials.</p><a name="items" id="items"></a>

  <h2><a name="roads" id="roads">Roads</a></h2>

  <p>In order to increase the movement rate of your units, roads can be
  constructed between regions. These roads allow for faster movement and do
  not become marshy during rain. They also will not become overgrown with
  trees, and always span rivers and canyons (bridges are automatically
  assumed to be part of any roads you build). In Eressea, rivers and such are
  not in the game because the size of the regions are so large. The scale of
  the game does not support rivers. Any unit which has the necessary skill
  and enough stones is able to build a road.</p>

  <p>Roads start in the middle of a region, and run towards any bordering
  region. Any region in Eressea is surrounded by six other regions, therefore
  any region can have up to six roads. A complete road between two regions
  consists of two pieces: one road from region A towards region B, and one
  road from region B towards region A. If you build a road from (6, 3)
  heading southwest, you must build a road in region (6, 2) heading northeast
  in order to connect the roads, and therefore connecting the two
  regions.</p>

  <p>Building roads requires a skill of 1, you can use 1 stone per skill
  level roadwork.</p>

  <p>In general, a road does not need any prerequisites. There are however,
  some region types which are so inhospitable, that they require special
  buildings before any roads can be built: in Glaciers, a tunnel, in Swamps,
  a dam, and in deserts, a Caravanserei.</p>

  <h2><a name="ships" id="ships">Ships</a></h2>

  <p>Ships are constructed from wood. This table shows how much wood is
  needed to build a specific ship. The larger the ship, the more difficult it
  is to build and to maneauver. Constructing ships requires a minimum skill
  level. Every person in a unit who has the minimum skill level can build the
  ship larger by one wood per round. Thus, a unit with 25 men, each having
  shipcraft level 2, would be able to build a longboat in 1 turn (25 men x 2
  skill levels = 50 wood used per turn to make the boat).</p>

  <p>Ships also have numbers with which they can be referred. Here is an
  example of a ship:</p>
  <pre>
Pride of the Seven Winds (f1a8), Longboat, (254/500). This beautiful ship was
the first one which was used by a family of merchants, the Plötzenbogens.
Captain Grom stands on the quarterdeck and gives orders to his sailors. He has
everything under control.
</pre>

  <p>Below the ship's entry, all units that are on board are listed (this is
  noted by indentation in your .nr report). The first unit, the captain,
  commands the ship. It decides which units are allowed to enter the ship. It
  can also rename the ship and it counts as a sailor.</p>

  <p>Once construction has begun, it is impossible to change. A ship that
  starts as a caravel cannot be changed to a longboat, etc.</p>

  <p>Units which are on board a ship are generally not able to perform any
  long orders. The captain of a ship can give the <a href=
  "orders.html#ROUTE">ROUTE</a> orders
  to sail the ship.</p>

  <p>The Aquarians are the only race which is able to perform long orders on
  the ocean. Of course, some long orders such as <a href=
  "orders.html#ENTERTAIN">ENTERTAIN</a>
  do not make any sense while on a ship in the ocean. Up to 100 aquarians per
  ocean region can <a href="orders.html#WORK">WORK</a> on the high seas. They
  will earn 10 silver a turn.</p>

  <p>In the event that a ship is docked in a land region, the units on board
  may do long orders. If the land region is guarded by a non-allied faction,
  the units onboard the ship may not <a href="orders.html#TAX">TAX</a>,
  <a href="orders.html#ENTERTAIN">ENTERTAIN</a>, or <a href=
  "orders.html#WORK">WORK</a>.</p>

  <p>Any ship which is too heavily loaded will not be able to sail. After the
  name and type of the ship, the extent of the cargo is shown. In the above
  example, 254 out of 500 weight units are currently used.</p>

  <p>All ships which are larger than a boat can only land on plains or forest
  regions. In all other kinds of regions (such as mountains or swamps) a harbour
  must be built before ships greater than a boat in size can land there. Ships
  can, however, cast off from any region. One can build a ship and set sail from
  any region.</p>

  <h3><a name="shipdamage" id="shipdamage">Damage to Ships</a></h3>

  <p>Travelling by ship is dangerous, and ships may be damaged during their
  voyages. This damage is indicated by a percent rating, and it reduces the
  capacity and speed of the ship. The time needed to sail is rounded up,
  making damage time consuming.</p>

  <p>The following events will damage a ship. The damage is given in
  percentage points, and will be added to damage the ship has already
  suffered. If the damage exceeds 100%, the ship will sink with all units on
  board.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The ship was involved in a fight which lasted longer than one round
    (20% damage).</li>

    <li>The ship was harmed by a spell (up to 90% damage).</li>

    <li>A tidal wave damages the ship (50% damage).</li>

    <li>The ship hits rocks (i.e. it tried to enter a region to which it is
    not allowed to land at, for example, a caravel trying to land at a region
    that is not a forest or plain; 10% damage).</li>

    <li>A ship at sea without enough sailors (30% damage per round).</li>

    <li>The ship does not have an owner (5% damage per round).</li>

    <li>The ship is hit by a storm and drifts off course (2% damage).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To repair a damaged ship, a unit must be given the order <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE">MAKE SHIP &lt;ship id&gt;</a>. Repairing and building
  ships both use the same base order.</p>

  <h2><a name="buildings" id="buildings">Buildings</a></h2>

  <p>Several buildings in Eressea offer distinct advantages to your faction.
  Except for castles, all of these buildings require maintenance in some form
  to ensure they are functioning and will not collapse from disuse. This
  maintenance can take the form of silver, stone, wood, even horses, and
  often more than one type of item.</p>

  <p>Maintenance costs are independent of the size of the building, and must
  be paid at the beginning of a round between the <a href=
  "orders.html#GIVE">GIVE command</a> and the long orders. Thus a unit is not
  able to collect taxes first and then pay for the building's maintenance. If
  you do not have enough money at the beginning of a turn, the building will
  not work. If you have enough money at the end of the turn, the building
  will remain unharmed, although you have not benefited from it this turn. If
  you still do not have enough money, then any allied factions using the
  <a href="orders.html#HELP">HELP SILVER</a> command may have enough silver
  on hand to save the building. Otherwise, it will collapse and kill some of
  the units inside. Maintenance costs are charged to the owner of the
  building, i.e. the first unit in the building.</p>

  <p>Maintenance costs have to be paid as soon as the construction has begun
  (except for the turn a <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE</a> command starts
  the construction of a new building).</p>

  <p>Like units on a ship, units in a building are indented beneath the
  building's name in your .nr report. As previously mentioned, the first unit
  in a building is the owner. It decides which other units may enter the
  building, it can name and describe the building and its faction must pay
  the maintenance upkeep for the building. The owner of the largest castle in
  a region may also rename and describe the region.</p>

  <p>Castles are different from other buildings in that they have multiple
  purposes, and do not require maintenance.</p>

  <h3><a name="castles" id="castles">Castles</a></h3>

  <p>Castles can be build by giving a unit the <a href="orders#MAKE">MAKE
  CASTLE</a> order. Only stone is required to build a castle, or enlarge an
  existing castle.</p>

  <p>Castles offer several benefits to the faction that controls them. The
  most important is that one cannot buy or sell luxury items in a region that
  does not have at least a size 2 castle. Furthermore, castles increase the
  income of peasants in the region, and also protect troops during
  attacks.</p>

  <p>The table below shows when a castle reaches a new size category. In
  general, one can say the larger the castle, the more difficult it is to
  enlarge. To enlarge a castle, the given minimum skill level in masonry must
  be met. Then one can stone can added to a castle for each person and each
  skill level per unit. A highly skilled unit with enough stones is able to
  construct a tower in one round.</p>

  <p>Like ships, castles have id numbers which are used for commands. Here is
  an example castle:</p>
  <pre>
The grand temple of the gold-eyed cat (58), Size 58, Tower; Hit by the sun's
rays the temple which is surrounded by trees gleams white. The slender tower
rising above the city can already be seen from a far distance. North of it the
city Xontormia stretches to the river Whyren which is vaulted next to the
harbour by an incredible high an long bridge.
</pre>

  <p>For every point of size, one person can be protected within the castle.
  These persons are the only units which will be protected by the castle
  during an attack. For each point of size, one stone is needed. The larger
  the castle, the more skilled workers you will need to enlarge it.</p>

  <p>A larger castle attracts more peasants, and improves the wealth of the
  people. All workers and peasants get a bonus to their income which depends
  on the size of the castle. In addition, the owner of the largest castle in
  a region receives a certain amount of money other players earn through
  selling luxury items in the region.</p>

  <p>Production points are calculated for masonry just like for any other
  production skill. For each production point a unit can extend a building by
  one size point (one stone in the case of castles). A unit with 20 men and
  level 1 masonry has 20 production points. Given enough stones it could
  build a fortification of size 10 but not further as extending a
  fortification requires at least a masonry skill level of 2. Starting again
  from scratch and with a skill level of 2 in masonry the unit would have 40
  production points which it would use to build a fortification of size 10.
  In the same turn it can extend this fortification as it has the required
  minimum skill level but the remaining 30 production points now have to be
  divided by the minimum skill level of 2, thus it could build a
  fortification of size 25 within one turn.</p>

  <h3>Other buildings</h3>

  <p>Other buildings can be built using the <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE &lt;building type&gt;</tt></a> and can be
  enlarged by using the <a href="orders.html#MAKE"><tt>MAKE &lt;building
  type&gt; &lt;building id.&gt;</tt></a> order. For example: <tt>MAKE
  lighthouse</tt> or <tt>MAKE smithy 3df1</tt>. For each building, a
  different minimum skill level of masonry is needed, which is given in the
  tables below. There are several buildings which have an upper size
  limit.</p>

  <p>A building only has an effect on a unit if the unit fits entirely into
  the building. This means that units with too many men to fit into a
  building do not receive the benefit even if they are the only unit in the
  building.</p>

  <p>If there are several units inside a building, they will be checked from
  top to bottom in the order listed on your report. The first unit which is
  too large for the building prevents all following units (even if those
  <b>will</b> fit) from receiving the benefits of the building.</p>
