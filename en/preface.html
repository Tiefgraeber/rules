  <h1>Preface</h1>

  <p>When we started Eressea back in 1996, we would never have guessed that
  it would grow as much as it did. As I write this in May 2001, Eressea has
  1,500 players in Germany alone. These English rules mark the beginning of
  another era for Eressea. We will finally be able to give the game to a much
  bigger audience. And we think you will like it, too.</p>

  <p>Eressea is a game that is played entirely through email. It is a turn
  based game, much like conventional strategy games, but with more complex
  rules, and more players at the same time. The world of Eressea is the same
  it was 5 years ago, although it has expanded over time to accomodate more
  and more players. It is filled with stories and legends of heroic battles,
  great deeds and empires long gone. In a way, it is very alive.</p>

  <p>To play, you have to send at least one email a week to the game server,
  explaining what you want your units (the people you control) to do. In
  return, you will get a weekly report telling you what happened in the
  world, showing you newly explored areas, results of your orders and
  messages from other players. At the moment, this happens once a week on
  Sunday. Your orders must arrive before 9 am, and the report will usually
  get to you before the end of the day.</p>

  <h2><a name="warning" id="warning">A warning</a></h2>

  <p>As in every major persistent online world, the rules for playing Eressea
  are subject to change. We have continuously tried to improve the rules,
  balancing them for better playability, and adding new features to provide
  more depth and an even better gaming experience. There are no guarantees
  that the rules stay the way they are (though most do).</p>

  <p>Eressea is a hobby. The core team of developers is spending many, many
  hours of unpaid time every week to keep it going. There have been times
  when we wanted to quit. Please remember that we're doing this as a free
  service.</p>

  <h2><a name="questions" id="questions">Got questions?</a></h2>

  <p>There is more than one face behind Eressea, and not everyone can answer
  all of your questions. To simplify communications, there are a number of
  addresses you can write to for help. If you have a question about the
  rules, please try writing to <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-help@kn-bremen.de">eressea-help@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>
  first. Your email will be read by volunteer players that are helping us
  deal with the sheer amount of questions that beginners usually have. They
  also know of any existing bugs in the game, should you be so unlucky to
  encounter one.</p>

  <p>If you feel your question must be answered by a gamemaster or developer,
  send it to <a href=
  "mailto:eressea-bugs@eressea.kn-bremen.de">eressea-bugs@eressea.kn-bremen.de</a>.
  If you found a new and previously unknown bug, see the section on
  <a href="/web/20070803081800/http://www.eressea.de/rules/en/bugs.html">bug reports</a> for details on how to report bugs.</p>
