  <p>Many people have helped to make Eressea the game it is today. The
  development team would like to thank (in no particular order):</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Benni Bärmann, Sören Schwarz, Martin Hershoff, Ingo Wilken and Stefan
    Reich for additional programming.</li>

    <li>The volunteers of eressea-help for relieving us of much of the
    support work.</li>

    <li>The authors of all the nice tools for Eressea.</li>

    <li>Everyone who ever organized one of the Eressea gatherings.</li>

    <li>Christian Büthe and Raphael Sturm, as well as everyone else who took
    part in the often heated debates about gameplay.</li>

    <li>Andreas Krawinkel, for his technical support.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Special thanks goes to Alex Schröder, who published his source for
  German Atlantis, and Russell Wallace, who invented and wrote the original
  Atlantis.</p>

  <h2><a name="technical" id="technical">Technical Tidbits</a></h2>

  <p>These are frequently out of date. In January 2006, the only running game
  of Eressea can be described by the following numbers:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Eressea has a total of over 100.000&nbsp;lines of code for
    server and tools which are written in C, C++ and LUA. In addition to code,
    there are approximately 900 kilobytes of XML configuration files. It was
    originally based on Russell Wallace's Atlantis 1.0, which had a mere 7000
    lines of code.</li>

    <li>The world of Eressea takes up 120 MBytes of disk space. There are more
    than 360.000 units in 1000&nbsp;factions.</li>

    <li>Running the server takes about 15 minutes. Compressing and sending all
    of the reports however takes half an hour.</li>
  </ul>
