  <h1>Skills</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>All units need skills to produce or use items, gather knowledge about
  magic or special information of regions etc. Skills are always accounted on
  a per-unit basis, i.e. all members of a unit have the same skills. Skills
  can be acquired and improved by learning them, some skills also improve
  when being used.</p>

  <p>The progress of learning a skill is measured in a so-called <em>skill
  level</em> which is recorded for every skill the unit masters. A skill
  level of 0 usually means that the unit is not experienced in that skill and
  thus cannot apply it. The higher the skill level the better a unit masters
  that skill.</p>

  <p>Only Aquarians can <a href="orders.html#LEARN">LEARN</a> on a ship which is
  on the ocean. If the ship is at land, all passengers can do something, except
  for the captain of the ship, should he wish to sail somewhere. Pay attention
  to the fact that men on the ship cannot <a href="orders.html#WORK">WORK</a>,
  <a href="orders.html#ENTERTAIN">ENTERTAIN</a>
  if the region is guarded by an un-allied faction.</p>

  <h2>Learning</h2>

  <p>A unit can try to advance in a skill by spending a turn learning it
  using the <a href="orders.html#LEARN"><tt>LEARN</tt></a> order. Learning a
  skill for a turn is not equivalent to reaching a new skill level since it
  becomes more and more difficult to advance in a skill with higher levels,
  i.e. the unit has to learn longer for each new skill level.</p>

  <p>Basically, a unit has to learn for as many turns as the value of the
  next skill level it can reach to actually acquire this level. Thus a unit
  at skill level 0 has to learn on average for 1 week to reach level 1.
  Getting to level 2 now takes another 2 weeks on average, acquiring level 3
  another 3 weeks and so on.</p>

  <p>Your units can have good or bad luck with learning and the duration of
  gaining a new skill level may vary somewhat but on average you can stick to
  the above rule. How long your units have to learn for certain skill levels
  also depends on the skill modifiers of your race.</p>

  <h2>Skill Modifiers</h2>

  <p>All races have different <a href="races.html#modifiers">modifiers</a> on
  their skills (have a look at the <a href="races.html#profiles">race
  profiles</a> on how race and terrain affect skills and learning). A
  positive skill modifier makes it easier for units of that race to learn or
  apply a skill, a negative modifier makes it harder, respectively.</p>

  <p>The effective skill level is calculated simply by adding the modifier to
  the skill level acquired by learning the skill. Usually, the effective
  skill level is your daily bread and butter: it is listed in your report and
  accounted for when applying skills, i.e. producing items, building ships,
  fighting etc. So in general, these rules always refer to the modified skill
  level if not stated otherwise.</p>

  <p>Take a freshly recruitet Dwarven unit for example:<br />
  At first it has no skills at all but to earn some money it needs to learn
  the taxation skill which it has a modifier of +1 for. Without learning,
  this modifier doesn't buy the unit anything, it still has to learn at least
  for one turn and thus reach skill level 1. Now the modifier comes into play
  - its value is added to the skill level reached through learning so the
  effective skill level is 2. This modified skill level is what the unit can
  actually make use of: in this case when taxing the peasants it is accounted
  a skill level of 2 instead of 1.</p>

  <p>Obviously, skill modifiers influence how quickly a unit can reach a
  certain skill level. E.g. Dwarfs need to learn the taxation skill only once
  to reach a skill level of 2 while Elves (with a modifier of 0) need to
  reach levels 1 and 2 successively taking them 3 weeks on average to get
  there.</p>

  <p>With a negative modifier things are essentially the same: a Halfling
  unit learning taxation for one turn would reach skill level 1 without
  taking the modifier into account. Unfortunately, Halflings have a pretty
  lousy physique to make much of an impression on peasants (actually, anyone)
  to get taxes out of them so their modifier on taxation is -1. Thus, one
  turn of learning does not get them anywhere, they still have an effective
  skill level of 0 (which might not show up in your report, still the Eressea
  server records it). The unit has to learn for another two weeks (on
  average, as always) to reach an effective skill level of 1 while that
  amount of learning would suffice for level 2 with Elves and level 3 with
  Dwarfes.</p>

  <h2>Applying Skills</h2>

  <p>In most cases it should be obvious which skill you require for which
  action in Eressea; details are listed below. Most skills a unit can
  actively use or apply (e.g. production skills) improve through such usage.
  But this is a rather slow process - on average it takes three times longer
  to reach the next skill level compared to learning.</p>

  <h2>Teaching</h2>

  <p>In Eressea, highly trained units can pass their experience to units with
  lower skill levels which cuts the time they spend learning for a skill
  level by half. For this to work the teaching unit uses the <a href=
  "orders.html#TEACH"><tt>TEACH &lt;unit-id&gt; [&lt;unit-id&gt;
  ...]</tt></a> order specifying the pupil units it wants to teach and the
  pupil unit uses the <a href="orders.html#LEARN"><tt>LEARN skill</tt></a>
  order with the skill to learn. The teacher does not specify the skill he
  wants to train a pupil in as this is determined by the pupil's order. Thus
  a teacher could even teach different pupil units in different skills.</p>

  <p>Teaching comes with these restrictions: the skill level of the teaching
  unit has to exceed the unit's skill level by at least 2 levels. Furthermore
  a teacher can share his knowledge with up to ten pupils, thus common
  combinations of teacher-to-pupil unit sizes are 1 to 10 or 10 to 100. When
  more than ten pupils try to benefit from a teacher their progress in
  learning is reduced proportionally.</p>

  <h2>Transferring and Recruiting Men</h2>

  <p>When men are added to a unit, these men bring their knowledge or their
  inexperience with them, which can lead to a <em>dilution</em> of the unit's
  skills.</p>

  <p>To determine a skill level after adding men to a unit calculate the
  average of the original skill levels weighted with the amount of men: when
  a unit with 2 fighters at a melee skill level of 3 recruits one peasant
  (which is treated as if a person with skill level 0 is added to the unit),
  the resulting skill level of that unit is <tt>(&lt;existing men&gt; *
  &lt;skill level&gt; + &lt;added men&gt; * &lt;skill level&gt;) / &lt;total
  men&gt;</tt>, i.e. <tt>(2 * 3 + 1 * 0) / 3 = 2</tt>.</p>

  <h2>Expensive Skills</h2>

  <p>The skills magic, alchemy, herbalism, espionage, and tactics are all
  difficult to learn, hence you must pay to learn them. Espionage costs 100
  silver per man for a week of training. Alchemy, herbalism, and tactics each
  cost 200 silver per man for a week of training. The costs for learning
  magic increase with skill level. You start with a cost of 100 silver, and
  may end up with a training cost of over 1000 silver. This <a href=
  "magic.html">table</a> shows the costs for increasing magic from level 0 to
  level 20. It does not matter if the unit has a teacher or not (although if
  it does, it will gain 60 skill points). The unit which wants to learn (or
  be taught) must have all the silver in its possession.</p>

  <p>If the unit does not have the full amount of silver it's progress in
  learning is reduced proportionally.</p>

  <h2>Miscellaneous details about certain skills</h2>

  <h3>Production of resources and objects</h3>

  <p>All items and resources are made with the <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE">MAKE</a> order. Most resources only need the appropriate
  region and skill level 1 to be produced. Most objects and items need higher
  skill levels. This <a href="production.html#ITEMS">table</a> lists all
  resources and objects, and what skills and resources are need to produce
  them.</p>

  <p>To produce an item, you must give a a unit the <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE">MAKE</a> "&lt;object name&gt;" order. For example, MAKE
  "iron", MAKE "sword", etc. You can also specify how many objects should be
  produced by putting the number between the MAKE order and the object name.
  For example, MAKE 10 "shield". The unit will produce 10 shields if there is
  enough iron and it has the necessary level of skill in armoursmithing (i.e.
  2), and the combined total skill levels needed (i.e. 20 total, such as 10
  men with skill level 2 each, or 2 men with skill level 10
  each).</p><a name="stealth" id="stealth"></a> <a name="espionage" id=
  "espionage"></a>

  <h3>Perception, Stealth and Espionage</h3>

  <p>The stealth skill can hide units, but if this unit is used to guard a
  region, or is on a ship or in a building, it will never be hidden, and is
  always visible.</p>

  <p>Other units can spot hidden units using the perception skill. A unit
  cannot be seen if the stealth skill level is greater than the perception
  skill level of another unit. In this case, the stealthy unit is invisible
  to the other unit. A unit if displayed if the perception skill level of
  your unit is as high or greater than the stealth skill level of another
  unit.</p>

  <p>Successfully hidden units can steal silver form other units with the
  <a href="orders.html#STEAL">STEAL</a> order. To discover the theft, the
  unit with the highest skill level in perception is compared with the
  stealth skill level of the robber. If the stealth level is as high as the
  perception level, the victim is only told that money has been stolen. If
  the perception level is greater than the stealth level, the victim gets
  detailed information about the theft, such as the indentity of the
  robber.</p>

  <p>A unit with a stealth skill level that is at least 3 levels above the
  highest sieging unit's perception level can leave the sieged castle at
  will. The most common use of this is to smuggle silver inside to feed the
  inhabitants.</p>

  <p>With the <a href="orders.html#SPY">SPY</a> order, you can receive
  information about another faction's units. The espionage level of the
  spying unit is compared with the added skill values of perception and
  stealth of the target unit. If the espoinate level of the spy is lower than
  combined value of the two skill, the spy learns nothing. If the two values
  are equal to the espionage level, the spy learns what skills the target
  unit has, but not their levels. If the espionage level is greater than the
  combined value, the spy learns both the skills and their skill levels. Any
  successful attempt also reveals the faction the target unit belongs to.</p>

  <p>Then the perception skill level of the victim is compared with the
  stealth skill level of the spy. If the perception level is less than the
  stealth level, the victim learns nothing. If these skills are equal, then
  the victim knows he was spied upon, but not by whom. If the perception
  level is greater than the stealth level, the victim receives information
  about which unit spied upon him.</p>

  <p>It costs 100 silver per person per week to learn espionage. Successfully
  using the stealth or espionate skills makes the unit more experienced in
  them.</p>

  <h3>Walking, Riding, Sailing and Shipcraft</h3>

  <p>There are many means to travel between regions. Walking, riding,
  sailing, etc. The <a href="orders.html#MOVE">MOVE</a> order controls all of
  these.</p>

  <p>A unit does not need any special abilities for walking. In order to ride
  horses, a unit needs the riding skill. The advantage to riding horses is
  that a unit can both go further and carry more, especially when using
  carts.</p>

  <p>You will need a unit with the taming skill to catch wild horses and the
  cartmaking skill to make carts. Use the <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE
  "horse" and MAKE "cart"</a> orders respectively.</p>

  <p>A unit with the riding skill can ride/lead two horses per person per
  skill level. Every two horses can lead a cart, so that large amounts of
  products can be transported between regions. If a unit uses carts, the
  persons in the unit sit in the cart, and not on the horses. Therefore, the
  weight of the unit's members is subtracted from the cart's carrying
  capacity.</p>

  <p>In order to sail, a unit needs both a ship and the sailing skill. The
  shipcraft skill is used to make boats from wood.</p>

  <p>The captain is the unit that steers a ship. It must have a certain skill
  level to sail different size vessels. This <a href=
  "travel.html#SAILING">table</a> lists the various ship types and the skills
  required to sail. The remaining skill needed to sail a vessel can come from
  any source. A trireme and a captain with level 4 sailing and 116 sailors
  with sailling 1, is just as good as the same captain with 20 men and
  sailing level 6.</p>

  <h3>Masonry and Roadwork</h3>

  <p>There are many buildings with various functions in Eressea. For example,
  castles, smithies, sawmilles, and lighthouses. To build any of these, you
  need a unit with the masonry skill and the appropriate resources for
  construction.</p>

  <p>A castle is built with the <a href="orders.html#MAKE">MAKE CASTLE</a>
  order. Any other kind of building is constructed with the <a href=
  "orders.html#MAKE">MAKE "&lt;building type&gt;"</a> order. A smithy, for
  example, would be build with the MAKE "smithy" order. You will need stone
  to build a castle. Most other types of buildings require wood, iron, and
  silver. Mage Towers even require Laen and Mallorn wood.</p>

  <p>You can also build roads to speed travel between regions. With the
  roadwork skill, you can build roads and bridges so that units can travel
  more than one region per turn. In some regions, you will need to build
  special buildings before you can build roads: Swamps require a dam, Deserts
  require a caravanserai, and Glaciers require a tunnel.</p>

  <h3>Magic</h3>

  <p>You can also use and experiment with spells using the magic skill.
  Spells fall into several categories, combat, ship, normal, etc. Each
  faction is only allowed to have up to 3 magicians, although Elves are
  allowed to have 4 as a special ability. It costs at least 100 silver per
  person per week to learn magic. See this <a href=
  "magic.html#MAGICCOSTS">table</a> for the costs of learning magic at all
  skill levels.</p>

  <p>You cast spells with the <a href="orders.html#CAST">CAST</a> order. You
  also use this order to make magical items.</p>

  <h3>Alchemy and Herbalism</h3>

  <p>A unit needs the herbalism skill to search for herbs. In every region a
  certain kind of herb is available. A unit can find about one herb per skill
  level and person.</p>

  <p>Units need the alchemy skill to turn those herbs into potions. Learning
  these skills costs 200 silver per person per week. Only 3 alchemists are
  allowed per faction.</p>

  <h3>Weapon skills and Endurance</h3>

  <p>Eressea has 5 different weapon skills: bow (bow, mallorn bow, elven
  bow), crossbow (crossbow, mallorn crossbow), catapult (catapult), melee
  (sword, claymore, axe, laensword), and polearm (spear, mallorn spear,
  lance, mallorn lance, halberd).</p>

  <p>Units gain additional hit points if they have skill levels in the
  endurance skill. See this <a href="combat.html#ENDURANCE">table</a> for the
  benefits of each level of endurance.</p>

  <p>More information about fighting is available in the <a href=
  "combat.html">combat chapter</a>.</p>
