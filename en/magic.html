  <h1>Magic</h1>

  <p>Magic is a mysterious and powerful means to accomplish your ends. In
  combat, it can wreak tremendous havoc amongst your enemies.</p>

  <p>There are five schools of magic: Illaun, Tybied, Gwyrrd, Cerddor and
  Draig. Every faction has to choose among those schools of magic by using
  the <a href="orders.html#LEARN"><tt>LEARN MAGIC &lt;school of
  magic&gt;</tt></a> order. Once a school has been chosen it cannot be
  changed. Every magician of that faction will learn their school
  automatically, there is no way to learn another school. It is not possible
  to change a faction's school of magic once any unit has learnt the magic
  skill.</p>

  <p>Any person with the magic skill counts as a magician and each faction
  may have only three of those at a time. It is possible to get rid of a
  magician by using the <a href="orders.html"><tt>FORGET</tt></a> command to
  remove the magic skill from a unit. Elves are an exception to the rules,
  they are allowed four magicians instead of the usual three. Learning the
  skill magic costs <tt>(50 + (50 * (1 + level) * (level / 2)))</tt> silver
  per person.</p>

  <p>Note that these costs can depend on modifiers, e.g. inside an <a href=
  "buildings.html#academy">academy</a> doubles the required amount of
  silver.</p>

  <p>Only magicians of the same school of magic can teach each other, though.
  Therefore, a Draig-magician cannot teach one of the Illaun school.</p>

  <p>When a magician does not have enough silver for learning, his chances of
  actually learning something in that turn decrease. This effect is
  proportional to the amount of silver he has and the required amount listed
  above.</p>

  <p>With every skill level the magician gains there is a chance he learns
  new spells. When a unit gains a new spell, its description will appear in
  the report once. Store these spell description so you can look them up
  anytime you need them. In case you lose your spell descriptions you can
  request them to be appear again in your next report via the <a href=
  "orders.html#SHOW"><tt>SHOW</tt></a> order (you are strongly discouraged
  from using this order every turn instead of storing your spells
  descriptions externally).</p>

  <p>A spell description looks like this:</p>
  <pre>
Big Bang

Description:

 This spell annihilates a complete island. The magician is teleported to a random region.

</pre>

  <p>Note: There is no such spell.</p>

  <h2><a name="spells" id="spells">Spells</a></h2>

  <p><a name="NORMALSPELLS" id="NORMALSPELLS"></a> Normal spells are cast by
  giving the <a href="orders.html#CAST"><tt>CAST</tt></a> order.
  <tt>CAST</tt> is a pseudo-long order, comparable with <tt>ATTACK</tt>. A
  unit can cast multiple spells per round but cannot execute other long
  orders. However, the Mana costs of subsequent spells multiply exponentially. The
  first spell in a turn costs the normal amount of mana in the spell
  description. The second spell costs twice that amount of Mana, the third
  costs four times the amount etc. Experience in the skill level is only
  gained for the first spell cast during a turn, i.e. by casting multiple
  spells a magician cannot improve his magic skill more quickly than other
  skills can be improved by applying them.</p>

  <p><a name="COMBATSPELLS" id="COMBATSPELLS"></a> Besides normal spells
  there are three different types of combat spells: pre-combat, combat, and
  post-combat. All three kinds can be used by issuing the <a href=
  "orders.html#COMBATSPELL"><tt>COMBATSPELL</tt></a> order. These spells are
  not cast normally. The order instead gives the unit permission to use the
  spell in case it is attacked. Depending on the type of spell, the unit will
  use it before, during, or after combat. You may also specify a level to use
  the spell at if you wish e.g. to reduce the consumption of mana. You may
  also add the <tt>NOT</tt> suffix to the order to tell the unit to stop
  using a certain spell in combat.</p>

  <p>If a magician has set a pre-combat spell, and is involved in combat, he
  will cast the spell once before the beginning of the battle.</p>

  <p>His combat spell will be cast once every combat round provided he has
  sufficient mana. Combat spells are not treated as normal spells with
  multiplicative costs. They always cost the standard amount of mana and do
  not increase the costs of other spells.</p>

  <p>If the magician survives the battle and has enough mana, he may then
  cast his post-combat spells.</p>

  <p>Combat spells are not cast like normal spells. The magician has to take
  part in the battle, preferrably somewhere in the rear battle row. See the
  <a href="orders.html#COMBAT"><tt>COMBAT</tt></a> order for more
  details.</p>

  <h2><a name="Mana" id="Mana">Mana</a></h2>

  <p>Mana is the magical power that magicians use for casting magic spells.
  Mana is consumed by casting spells and it regenerates over time. A magician
  can store up to a certain amount of mana depending entirely upon his magic
  skill level. The rate at which the magician regenerates mana is also solely
  dependent upon his skill level in magic. The exact numbers may be found in
  your report but as a rule of thumb it is reasonable that a magician can
  store up to skill<sup>2</sup> mana at any one time and recover up to his
  skill level in mana per turn. This number may vary between zero and the
  actual skill level however. Magic resistant races regerate mana somewhat
  faster than non-magic resistant races.</p>

  <p>The maximum amount of mana is not constant. There is a spell by which
  one magician can transfer mana to another. The receiving magician can raise
  his maximum amount of mana for a turn when this spell is used. He may cast
  spells which cost more mana than his maximum. Surplus mana above his
  maximum is lost at the end of the turn.</p>

  <p><a name="permanentmana" id="permanentmana"></a> Some spells actually
  cost permanent mana. After casting the spell, the magician can store less
  overall mana. Only very potent and powerful spells that cause lasting
  effects cost permanent mana.</p>

  <h2><a name="components" id="components">Components</a></h2>

  <p>If the spell descriptions shows just a certain amount of mana below the
  spell the costs of the spell are constant. For example, the Big Bang spell
  always costs 1,500 mana. If there is a cost like "3 Mana * level", the
  amount of mana used per casting is three times the skill level of the
  magician. Mostly, but not always, the level corresponds with the magic
  skill level of the magician. The cost of casting these spells can be
  reduced by casting it at a lower level than the actual skill level of the
  magician. See the <a href="orders.html#CAST"><tt>CAST</tt></a> order for
  more details. If <a href="magic.html#permanentmana">permanent mana</a> is required to
  cast the spell, the magician's maximum mana is reduced as well. Further
  components may include herbs, resources, money, potions, or even more rare
  items.</p>

  <h2><a name="Modifications" id="Modifications">Modifications</a></h2>

  <p>Some spells can be cast with a variable power level. This level must be
  lower than the magician's skill level in magic, and can even be lower than
  the default level of the spell. By casting a spell with a lower power level
  a spell can be cast to create a lesser effect and cost less mana.</p>
  <pre>
CAST LEVEL &lt;n&gt; "&lt;spell name&gt;"
</pre>

  <p>This also applies to combat spells:</p>
  <pre>
COMBATMAGIC LEVEL &lt;n&gt; "&lt;combat spell name&gt;"
</pre>

  <p>This is useful for saving mana to use on post-combat spells</p>

  <h2><a name="remotespells" id="remotespells">Remote Spells</a></h2>

  <p>Spells may be cast remotely, allowing casters to cause effects in
  regions other than the one they are currently residing in. To use a remote
  spell, use the following syntax:</p>
  <pre>
CAST REGION &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; "&lt;Spell&gt;"
</pre>

  <p>In this case, the spell will affect the indicated region. However, this
  modification raises the costs of all components required by the spell. The
  material costs are multiplied with 2<sup>(distance)</sup> between the location of the
  caster and the target. If the magician casts several spells in a round, the
  costs are multiplied with 2<sup>(X-1)</sup>, where X is the number of spells. The
  following tables illustrate the costs:</p>

    <table border="0" cellpadding="3">
      <tr bgcolor="#DDDDDD">
        <th>distance (regions)</th>
        <td align="center">0</td>
        <td align="center">1</td>
        <td align="center">2</td>

        <td align="center">8 stones / 40 iron / 80 wood</td>
        <td align="center">16 stones / 80 iron / 160 wood</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <br />

    <table border="0" cellpadding="3">

        <td align="center">0</td>

        <td align="center">10 mana</td>
        <td align="center">20 mana</td>
        <td align="center">40 mana</td>
        <td align="center">80 mana</td>
        <td align="center">160 mana</td>
      </tr>

        <td align="center">80 mana</td>
        <td align="center">160 mana</td>
        <td align="center">320 mana</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

  <p>The spell's power level can also be changed for a remotely cast
  spell:</p>
  <pre>
CAST REGION &lt;x&gt; &lt;y&gt; LEVEL &lt;n&gt; "&lt;spell name&gt;"
</pre>

  <p>Note: It is very important to specify the region before the level of the
  spell.</p>

  <p>Besides remote spells there are two other special types of spells. As a
  rule of thumb, spells cannot be cast on ships that are sailing. The only
  exceptions are ship-spells. Furthermore, sea-spells can be cast on sea by
  non-aquarian magicians.</p>

  <h2><a name="Rank" id="Rank">Rank</a></h2>

  <p>The order in which spells take effect is based upon the spell's rank.
  During a turn spells are cast in order of increasing rank. Rank 1 is the
  lowest (and fastest), while rank 9 is the highest (and slowest). Most
  spells have a standard rank of 5, while anti-magic spells almost always
  have a rank of 2. Spells of the same rank are cast in the same order
  indicated by the orders</p>

  <h2>Example:</h2>

  <p>There are three spells, named "A", "B", and "C".<br />
  A has rank 5 and costs 10 mana.<br />
  B has rank 2 and costs 20 mana.<br />
  C has rank 5 and costs 5 mana.<br />
  <br />
  Assume that a magician has the orders:</p>
  <pre>
CAST "C"
CAST "B"
CAST "A"
</pre>

  <p>First B is cast because that spell has rank 2. It is the first spell of
  the magicians in this turn, and therefore costs the normal 20 mana. Then
  spell C is cast because it is first in the orders, and has the same rank as
  spell A. C is the second spell of the turn, and costs double (5 * 2^1 = 10)
  mana. Lastly, A is cast. Since A is the third spell of the turn, A costs
  quadruple mana (10 * 2^2 = 40).</p>

  <h2><a name="fizzles" id="fizzles">Spell failure: fizzles</a></h2>

  <p>There are intrinsic risks to using magic. Many spells have hidden risks
  and may backfire. A spell can simply fail even if all the components are
  present and the caster has sufficient mana.</p>

  <p>This is not a bug - you receive a typical message in your report ("The
  spell failed."). Any missing components or mana will also be mentioned.
  Remember that spells are not failsafe; any spell has a chance of
  failing.</p>

  <p>The probability of a fizzle depends on many factors, such as the skill
  level of the caster, the power level of the spell, the target, the
  location, etc. Be warned: fizzles can have very unpleasant side
  effects!</p>

  <h2><a name="magicresistance" id="magicresistance">Magic
  Resistance</a></h2>

  <p>The magic resistance of a unit is each persons inherent ability to
  resist spells directed against him. The most common effect of magic
  resistance is reduced damage from combat spells against a unit. The magic
  resistance of a unit is basically equal to the natural magic resistance of
  the unit's race. Magic resistance against a spell is also influenced by the
  unit's experience. The bonus to resistance depends upon the unit's highest
  skill level, and is compared to the magician's magic skill level. The basic
  chance of success is approximately 50% if the magician and the target both
  have equal skill levels.</p>

  <p>In combat, magic resistance is also affected by certain weapons and
  armor, most notably Laen shields or Laen mail. Otherwise, only natural
  racial magic resistance and experience can protect a unit from a magical
  assault on the battlefield.</p>

  <p>Even inanimate objects like ships, buildings or even regions have a small
  innate magic resistance.</p>

  <h2><a name="magetowers" id="magetowers">Mage towers</a></h2>

  <p><a href="buildings.html#Magetower">Mage towers</a> increase the mana
  regeneration of a magician by +50% and increase the effective power level
  of each spell by 1 in addition to the modifiers incurred by a ring of power
  without increasing the mana costs. Additionally, the probabiliy of a
  <a href="magic.html#fizzles">spell failure</a> is greatly reduced.</p>

  <h2><a name="familiar" id="familiar">Familiars</a></h2>

  <p>Note to first-time readers: If you are a new player, it's safe to
  skip this section of the manual. Familiars are high-level magic and won't
  be important for you until sometime later in the game.</p>

  <p>During their travel, seasoned magicians will occasionally befriend an
  extraordinary creature of an unusual species that will join them.</p>

  <p>The empathic bond with their familiars makes it possible for magicians
  to channel spells through them. Spells cast in this way affect the region
  the familiar is in, and do not to be remote spells. There are a few
  restrictions to channeling a spell through the familiar. To channel a
  spell through the familiar, give the <a href="orders.html#CAST">CAST</a>
  order to the familiar instead of the magician. The level of the spell may
  not be larger than the magic skill level of the familiar or half the skill
  of the magician. The cost of the spell is doubled.</p>

  <p>Very few familiars are given the gift of spellcasting, but all of them
  can serve as a medium to their masters. This is why they have no mana of
  their own -- whenever a magician casts a spell through the medium he only
  uses his own mana. Those few familiars that are skilled in magic are able
  to learn spells, and these spells can even differ from those of their
  masters.</p>

  <p>Many familiars are able to learn certain skills or have additional
  special abilities. The familiar gives a bonus on every talent to the magician
  (except magic) in which the familiar is proficient. The magician can get
  a description of these abilites using the <a href="orders.html#SHOW">SHOW
  &lt;race&gt;</a> command.</p>


  <h2><a name="astralspace" id="astralspace">Astral space</a></h2>

  <p>Note: You can skip this section if you are reading the manual for the
  first time because it takes lots of weeks before your faction is able to
  travel into astral space.</p>

  <p>There are about as many opinions about the origins of this phenomenon
  as there are names for it: some scholars call it the world of spirits, some
  the astral planes, but most commonly it's called 'astral space'.</p>

  <p>Only magic can bend reality in such a way that people can cross over
  into this other plane, where the laws of nature seem to be mere
  guidelines, easily ignored. While people and equipment can be sent,
  horses, carts, catapults and other large objects cannot be taken across.
  In astral space, the senses are clouded, vision is fogged, noises are
  dull and dampened.</p>

  <p>When you enter astral space, you disappear entirely from the material
  world. This may be the reason why in astral space, it is still possible
  to use magic. By blurring the barriers between the two planes, it is
  possible to gain certain advantages -- this could be the perception of
  things on the other side without being seen, or a fast journey over
  large distances. Travel in astral space is swift and distances seem
  shorter.</p>

  <p>But beware that astral space is a dangerous place. There are terrible
  beasts which cannot be slain by usual weapons, and which mercilessly
  steal their victims' will and memories. Only those that have powerful
  magical weapons at their command or able to hide from these abominations
  will be safe from the horrors of astral space.</p>

  <h2><a name="request" id="request">A request to the players</a></h2>

  <p>We ask all the players to keep the spells as much of a secret as
  possible. Talking amongst your allies about your faction's powers is all
  right. We suggest that you keep your spells' exact abilities secret, in
  order to make you more valuable to your allies. In this manner, they will
  never know for sure when you are needed, or not needed, and the alliance
  will be more secure. Please do not create web pages with all the spell
  descriptions or send information through the mailing lists. We feel that
  part of the enjoyment from Eressea is learning about new spells through
  discovery. We know that we cannot control everyone, and we hope there is
  enough integrity in Eressea that we can rely upon this soft rule to be
  voluntarily obeyed. Thank you.</p>
