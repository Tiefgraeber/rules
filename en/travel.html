  <h1>Movement: On Land and Sea</h1>

  <p>In one week, a unit may move one land region by foot. If the unit has
  sufficient riding skill and an appropriate number of horses, the unit may
  move up to two land regions. If the regions are connected by roads, units
  on foot may move two land regions, and units mounted on horses may move up
  to three regions.</p>

  <p>In order to regulate unit movement, the world of Eressea is divided into
  a hexagonal grid. The six directions allowed are: Northeast, East,
  Southeat, Northwest, West, Southwest. Direct movement to the north or south
  is no possible.</p>

  <p>The <a href="orders.html#CARRY">CARRY &lt;unit id&gt;</a> order allows
  units to carry another whiel moving. The carried unit must be given the
  <a href="orders.html#RIDE">RIDE &lt;unit id&gt;</a> order. With the CARRY
  and RIDE system is is possible for units that have no riding skill to ride
  with a unit that does have riding skill and horses or carts. Units on foot
  can CARRY other units if their total carry capacity is sufficient. Carrying
  units do not need horses or carts, sufficient numbers of men can carry
  other units. See the <a href="races.html#profiles">races chapter</a> for
  the weight and capacity of certain races.</p>

  <p>While travelling through a region, units can have their movement
  prevented by other units guarding the region with the <a href=
  "orders.html#GUARD">GUARD</a> order.</p>

  <p>A unit or ship is overloaded when its carrying capacity is exceeded. In
  all situations, any unit or ship that is overloaded cannot move. The weight
  a unit is carrying including silver and all items, as well as any units it
  is carrying. The table below lists the weights and carrying capacities of
  all races and other vehicles. This <a href=
  "production.html#ITEMS">table</a> lists the weights of all items in the
  game.</p>

  <h2><a name="roads" id="roads">Roads</a></h2>

  <p>Building roads allows units to move one additional region. On a network
  of roads, a unit may move up to 2 regions on foot, or 3 regions by horse.
  In order to take advantage of this, the unit must move continuously on
  completed roads.</p>

  <h2><a name="riding" id="riding">Horses and carts</a></h2>

  <p>Any unit with the riding skill and enough horses can use the horses for
  transportation when moving. This allows the unit to travel one additional
  region.</p>

  <p>Any unit without the riding skill can lead one horse by hand, per
  person. This means the unit still move by foot, but leads the horse with
  him. A unit leading a horse would move one region on foot, two regions if
  complete roads are present.</p>

  <p>If a unit does have the riding skill, the number of horses and carts it
  may travel with is dependant on the riding skill of the unit, and how far
  the unit is ordered to travel. If the unit only moves 1 region (or 2
  regions along a road), each person in a unit with riding skill can move up
  to 4 horses per level of riding skill. If moving 2 regions (or 3 regions
  along a road), each person in a unit with riding skill can move up to 2
  horses per level of riding skill. You allways need riding skill to use
  carts and then for every 2 horses, a unit is allowed to use 1 cart. If a
  unit is allowed to travel with 8 horses, it may also use 4 carts. If it
  only uses 2 horses, it may move 1 cart.</p>

  <p>Most <a href="races.html#profiles">races</a> have a carrying capacity of
  5.4 weight units. A horse has a carrying capacity of 20 weight units.
  Therefore, 2 persons could ride on one horse, or one person could ride a
  horse carrying 10 swords. In theory, everything can be transported by a
  unit, including other units. Note that carts weight 40 weight units. A unit
  with horses or using carts can go on foot and not use up space in the cart.
  In this manner, the unit can carry additional items in addition to what the
  cart can carry. Simply put, the unit is walking alongside the cart, rather
  than riding in it. A unit moving only 1 region on land, or 2 regions along
  roads is automatically considered to be moving by foot.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A unit with 4 persons and a riding skill of 1 can move at most, 20
    horses and one reagion (or 2 regions on roads). This is calculated as
    follows: 4 people can lead 4 horses. In addition, each person can lead an
    additional 4 horses beause of their riding skill level (4 + (4 * 4) =
    20).<br />
    <br />
    A unit with 5 dwarves without the riding skill can move one region on
    foot (or 2 regions along roads) with up to 5 horses. In this case, the
    carrying capacity of these 5 dwarves and 5 horses is 127 weight units ((5
    * 5.2) + (5 * 20) = 127).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Carts have a carrying capacity of 140 weigt units, which means they can
  carry large amounts of goods. Each cart needs 2 horses (or 4 Trolls) to
  pull it. Horses that are pulling a cart cannot carry anything else as it
  takes all their strength to pull the cart. Note that 2 horses have a carry
  capacity of 40 weight units, which is identical to the weight of the cart
  itself. However, 4 Trolls can push a cart plus an additional 3.2 weight
  units. In either case, if you wish to move carts without using Trolls, you
  must have the riding skill and horses. Carts can still be carryed as
  freight rather than used to transport goods, but they are very heavy,
  weighin 40 weight units a piece.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Example, one person with riding skill 1 has one cart and two horses,
    and wishes to move two regions without roads. In this case, the owner of
    the cart can move 130 weight units with him (i.e. 130 swords) as the two
    horses pull the cart. The cart can carry up to 140 weight units, but 10
    units of this is occupied by the cart owner as he rides along with the
    cargo. In another example, a unit with 4 persons and riding skill 1 could
    move eight carts using 16 horses one region, or it could move 4 carts
    with 8 horses two regions. If you want to move 1 person with 1 cart and 2
    horses on a ship, then the ship must have 150 weight units available on
    board to carry the person, 2 horses and cart (10 + 40 + 100 = 150).</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>If a unit has too many horses, or is carrying too much weight, the unit
  cannot move.</p>

  <p>Note that carrying capacity is calculated on a unit by unit basis.
  Therefore 1 Person with Riding skill 3 and 6 horses and 3 carts wishing to
  move 1 region (walking in this case) has a carrying capacity of ((3 * 140)
  + 5.4) = 425.4 WU and therefore this example unit can move 7 stones if it
  wishes only to move one region. If this example unit wants to move 2
  regions (not on a road) then it can only carry 6 stones, as the person must
  ride on the cart and this means then that carrying capacity of the unit is
  420 WU minus 10 WU (the weight of the driver on the cart) = 410 WU. 7
  Stones weigh (7 * 60) 420 WU. So, this unit can not move 2 regions (without
  roads) with 7 stones, as it would be overloaded.</p>

  <h2><a name="sailing" id="sailing">Ship Movement</a></h2>

  <p>Only with ships can you leave your island and make contact with or
  engage in trade with other factions on other islands. With a ship it is
  possible to move up to 7 regions (even more than 7 regions with the help of
  aquarians or with magic!).</p>

  <p>All ships greater in size than a boat can only come onto a land region
  (landing if you will) at Plains or Forest regions. All other terrain
  (region) types require someone to build a harbour in them in order for
  ships greater than a boat in size to land at. Ships can, however, cast off
  from any region. One can build a ship and set sail from any region.</p>

  <p>No ship can move directly from one land (coastal) region to another land
  (coastal) region. Any ship that is landed must first then sail onto the
  ocean before it can move to another land region. Additionally, a ship that
  is landed can only sail out onto the ocean in the direction from which it
  came from when it landed or in a direction adjacent to the direction from
  which it arrived at the land (coastal) region. For example, a ship arrives
  onto a land (coastal) region from the west, if this ship wishes then to
  depart (sail out) from this region it can only go west, northwest, or
  southwest. Ships on land in a region with a harbour can move toward any
  direction, so long as the region they are moving to is an ocean region and
  your faction commands the harbour building or the faction that does command
  the harbour building has <a href="orders.html#HELP"><tt>HELP GUARD</tt></a>
  for your faction.</p>

  <p>On the open sea (ocean regions that are not adjacent to any land
  regions) it is possible your ships can be sent off course or even damaged
  by storms, beware!</p>

  <p>In order to move a ship you need trained a trained crew, that is a unit
  (or units) that have learned the skill "Sailing". On <a href=
  "travel.html#sailing">this chart</a> under "Captain" is listed the minimum
  skill of the Ship Captain (that is the first unit on your report under the
  named ship) in order for the unit to move the ship. Example, in order to
  move a caravel, the ship captain unit must at least have Sailing skill 3.
  In addition to this, on board the ship must be a certain amount of "Total
  skill" in sailing skill, depending on the type of ship. The below chart
  lists the total sailing skill needed on board a ship to move it. This total
  sailing skill includes the captain unit and also includes any allies of the
  ship captain unit on board the ship that have sailing skill. The range of
  the ship is the distance in numbers of region such a ship can move in one
  week. Note, however, that any ship that has an aquarian Ship Captain
  receives a bonus of +1 to it's range, therefore a Trireme captained by an
  aquarian can move 8 regions per week. (Migrant aquarians in a human faction
  do not receive this bonus).</p>

  <p>Any ship without enough qualified crew can not sail out. If, for
  whatever reason, a ship on the ocean finds itself without enough qualified
  crew then the ship can not be controlled and will drift randomly until the
  ship drifts onto land. However, any ship that is adrift will break apart
  (takes damage), such that after a short period of time it will sink (see
  also <a href="production.html#shipdamage">here</a>).</p>

  <p>Every ship type has a carrying capacity. Any ship that is overloaded can
  not sail out. The weight of everything on board a ship counts towards the
  ships carrying capacity (people, silver, horses, carts, etc.) The listing
  of ship capacity is found in <a href="travel.html#sailing">this chart</a>
  and is also listed in your report</p>

  <p>A unit that finds itself on a ship on the ocean at the start of any week
  can not do any long orders, except aquarians. Aquarians are permitted to do
  long orders on the ocean. Of course, all ship captains (regardless of their
  race) are allowed to move the ship with the long order <a href=
  "orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a> or <a href=
  "orders.html#ROUTE"><tt>ROUTE</tt></a>. In any case, units on board a ship,
  just as on land, require 10 silver per week per person to live
  (representative of food). Hint: Make sure you keep an eye on that.</p>

  <p>Any unit that wishes to get off of a ship onto land must do so with the
  <a href="orders.html#LEAVE"><tt>LEAVE</tt></a> order. If the region wherein
  the unit gets off of the ship (LEAVE) is not guarded by a non-ally, then
  the unit may move with the <a href="orders.html#MOVE"><tt>MOVE</tt></a>
  order in that same week, otherwise, the unit must wait one week before it
  may move if the region is indeed guarded by a non-ally. These same rules
  apply to attempting movement by <a href=
  "orders.html#RIDE"><tt>RIDE</tt></a> and <a href=
  "orders.html#CARRY"><tt>CARRY</tt></a> orders after getting off of a
  ship</p>

  <p>Aquarians can swim from an ocean region onto a directly adjacent land
  region (with the MOVE order), but the reverse is not true. Aquarians can
  not swim from a land region onto any ocean region. Swimming aquarians can
  take with them anything (items, etc.) with the exception of horses.</p>
